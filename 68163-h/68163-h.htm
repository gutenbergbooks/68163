<h2>FOREWORD</h2>
</div>


<p>Outlining is a modern art. For centuries we have collected and
selected, compiled and compended, but only of late have we outlined.</p>

<p>And an Outline is a result differing in kind from the other work
mentioned, and presenting different conditions and contingencies.</p>

<p>An Outline, owing to its sweep of magnificent distances, can touch
only the high spots, and can but skim those. Not in its province is
criticism or exhaustive commentary. Not in its scope are long effusions
or lengthy extracts.</p>

<p>Nor may it include everybody or everything that logically belongs to it.</p>

<p>An Outline is at best an irregular proposition, and the Outliner must
follow his irregular path as best he may. But one thing is imperative,
the Outliner must be conscientious. He must weigh to the best of his
knowledge and belief the claims to inclusion that his opportunities
present. He must pick and choose with all the discernment of which he
is capable and while following his best principles of taste he must
sink his personal preferences in his regard for his Outline as a whole.</p>

<p>Nor can he pick and choose his audience. To one reader,&mdash;or critic,&mdash;a
hackneyed selection is tiresome, while to another it is a novelty and
a revelation. And it must be remembered that a hackneyed poem is a
favorite one and a favorite is one adjudged best, by a consensus of
human opinion, and is therefore a high spot to be touched upon.</p>

<p>While the Outline is generally chronological, it is not a history and
dates are not given. Also, when it seemed advisable to desert the
chronological path for the topographical one, that was done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span></p>

<p>Yet Foreign Literatures cannot be adequately treated in an Outline
printed in English. Translations are at best misleading. If the
translation is a poor one, the pith and moment of the original is
partly, or wholly lost. And if the translation be of great merit, the
work may show the merit of the new rendition rather than the original.</p>

<p>And aside from all that, few translations of Humor are to be found.</p>

<p>The translators of foreign tongues choose first the philosophy, the
fiction or the serious poetry of the other nations, leaving the humor,
if any there be, to hang unplucked on the tree of knowledge.</p>

<p>So the foreign material is scant, but the high spots are touched as far
as could be found convenient.</p>

<p>The Outline stops at the year 1900. Humor since then is too close to be
viewed in proper perspective.</p>

<p>But the present Outliner mainly hopes to show how, with steady
footstep, from the Caveman to the current comics Humor has followed the
Flag.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p>Speaking exactly, an Outline of the World’s Humor is an impossibility.</p>

<p>For surely the adjectives most applicable to humor are elusive,
evasive, evanescent, ephemeral, intangible, imponderable, and other
terms expressing unavailability.</p>

<p>To outline such a thing is like trying to trap a sunbeam or bound an
ocean.</p>

<p>Yet an Outline of the History of the World’s recorded humor as evolved
by the Human Race, seems within the possibilities.</p>

<p>First of all, it must be understood that the term humor is here used in
its broadest, most comprehensive sense. Including both wit and humor;
including the comic, fun, mirth, laughter, gayety, repartee,&mdash;all types
and classes of jests and jokes.</p>

<p>The earliest reference to this mental element is that of Aristotle, and
the word he uses to represent it is translated the Ridiculous.</p>

<p>His definition states that the Ridiculous is that which is in itself
incongruous, without involving the notion of danger or pai</p>

<p>Coleridge thus refers to Aristotle’s definition:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Where the laughable is its own end, and neither inference nor moral
is intended, or where at least the writer would wish it so to appear,
there arises what we call drollery. The pure, unmixed, ludicrous
or laughable belongs exclusively to the understanding, and must be
presented under the form of the senses; it lies within the spheres of
the eye and the ear, and hence is allied to the fancy. It does not
appertain to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span> reason or the moral sense, and accordingly is alien
to the imagination. I think Aristotle has already excellently defined
the laughable, τò γελοíον, as consisting of, or depending on, what is
out of its proper time and place, yet without danger or pain. Here
the <i>impropriety</i>&mdash;τò ἄτοπον&mdash;is the positive qualification; the
<i>dangerlessness</i>&mdash;τò ἀχίνδυνον&mdash;the negative. The true ludicrous
is its own end. When serious satire commences, or satire that is felt
as serious, however comically drest, free and genuine laughter ceases;
it becomes sardonic. This you experience in reading Young, and also not
unfrequently in Butler. The true comic is the blossom of the nettle.”</p>
</div>

<p>Yet, notwithstanding Coleridge’s scientific views on the subject, Humor
is not an exact science. It is, more truly, an art, whose principles
are based on several accepted theories, and some other theories, not so
readily accepted or admitted only in part by these who have thought and
written on the subject.</p>

<p>A true solution of the mystery of why a joke makes us laugh, has yet to
be found. To the mind of the average human being, anything that makes
him laugh is a joke. Why it does so, there are very few to know and
fewer still to care.</p>

<p>Nor are the Cognoscenti in much better plight. A definition of humor
has been attempted by many great and wise minds. Like squaring the
circle, it has been argued about repeatedly, it has been written about
voluminously. It has been settled in as many different ways as there
have been commentators on the subject. And yet no definition, no
formula has ever been evolved that is entirely satisfactory.</p>

<p>Aristotle’s theory of the element of the incongruous has come to be
known as the Disappointment theory, or Frustrated Expectation.</p>

<p>But Aristotle voiced another theory, which he, in turn, derived from
Plato.</p>

<p>Plato said, though a bit indefinitely, that the pleasure we derive in
laughing at the comic is an enjoyment of other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span> people’s misfortune,
due to a feeling of superiority or gratified vanity that we ourselves
are not in like plight.</p>

<p>This is called the Derision theory, and as assimilated and expressed
by Aristotle comes near to impinging on and coinciding with his own
Disappointment theory.</p>

<p>Moreover, he attempted to combine the two.</p>

<p>For, he said, we always laugh at someone, but in the case, where
laughter arises from a deceived expectation, our mistake makes us laugh
at ourselves.</p>

<p>In fact, Plato held, in his vague and indefinite statements that there
is a disappointment element, a satisfaction element, and sometimes a
combination of the two in the make-up of the thing we are calling Humor.</p>

<p>All of which is not very enlightening, but it is to be remembered that
those were the first fluttering flights of imagination that sought to
pin down the whole matter; yet among the scores that have followed,
diverging in many directions, we must admit few, if any, are much more
succinct or satisfactory.</p>

<p>The Derision or Discomfiture Theory holds that all pleasure in laughing
at a comic scene is an enjoyment of another’s discomfiture. Yet it must
be only discomfiture, not grave misfortune or sorrow.</p>

<p>If a man’s hat blows off and he runs out into the street after it, we
laugh; but if he is hit by a passing motor car, we do not laugh. If a
fat man slips on a banana peel and lands in a mud puddle, we laugh; but
if he breaks his leg we do not laugh.</p>

<p>It is the ridiculous discomfiture of another that makes a joke, not the
serious accident, and though there are other types and other theories
of the cause of humor, doubtless the majority of jokes are based on
this principle.</p>

<p>From the Circus Clown to Charlie Chaplin, episodes of discomfiture
make us laugh. Every newspaper cartoon or comic series hinges on the
discomfiture of somebody. The fly on the bald head, the collar button
under the bureau, the henpecked husband, all depend for their humor on
the trifling misfortune that makes its victim ridiculous.</p>

<p>An enjoyment of this discomfiture of a fellow man is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span> inherent in human
nature, and though there are subtler jests, yet this type has a grip on
the risibilities that can never be loosened.</p>

<p>Can we doubt that it was the Serpent’s laughing at the discomfiture of
Adam and Eve, caught in <i>deshabille</i>, that caused them to rush for
the nearest fig tree? Or perhaps, their eyes being opened, they laughed
at one another. Anyway, they were decidedly discomfited, and did their
best to remedy matters.</p>

<p>This Derision Theory includes also the jests at the ignorance or
stupidity of another. The enormous vogue of the Noodle jokes, some
centuries ago, hinged on the delight felt in the superiority of the
hearer over the subject of the jest. All laughable blunders, every
social <i>faux pas</i>, all funny stories of children’s sayings and
doings are based on the consciousness of superiority. Practical jokes
represent the simplest form of this theory, as in them the discomfiture
of the other person is the prime element, with no subtle byplay to
relieve it.</p>

<p>A mild example is the polite rejoinder of the street car conductor when
a lady asked at which end of the car she should get off.</p>

<p>“Either end, madame,” he responded, “both ends stop.”</p>

<p>An extreme specimen is the man who told the story of a burning
house&mdash;“I saw a fellow up on the roof,” he related, “and I called to
him, ‘Jump, and I’ll catch you in a blanket!’ Well, I had to laugh,&mdash;he
jumped,&mdash;and I didn’t have no blanket!”</p>

<p>Implied discomfiture is in the story of the agnostic, who was buried
in his evening clothes. “Poor Jim,” said a funeral guest; “he didn’t
believe in Heaven and he didn’t believe in Hell; and there he lies, all
dressed up and no place to go!”</p>

<p>Almost a practical joke is the man who, reading a newspaper, suddenly
exclaimed, “Why, here’s a list of people who won’t eat onions any
more!” And when his hearer asked to see the list, he handed over the
obituary column.</p>

<p>The Disappointment Theory, though overlapping the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span> Derision Theory at
times, is based on the idea that the essence of the laughable is the
incongruous.</p>

<p>Hazlitt says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We laugh at absurdity; we laugh at deformity. We laugh at a
bottle-nose in a caricature; at a stuffed figure of an alderman in a
pantomime, and at the tale of Slaukenbergius. A dwarf standing by a
giant makes a contemptible figure enough. Rosinante and Dapple are
laughable from contrast, as their masters from the same principle make
two for a pair. We laugh at the dress of foreigners, and they at ours.
Three chimney-sweepers meeting three Chinese in Lincoln’s Inn Fields,
they laughed at one another till they were ready to drop down. Country
people laugh at a person because they never saw him before. Any one
dressed in the height of the fashion, or quite out of it, is equally an
object of ridicule. One rich source of the ludicrous is distress with
which we cannot sympathize from its absurdity or insignificance. It is
hard to hinder children from laughing at a stammerer, at a negro, at
a drunken man, or even at a madman. We laugh at mischief. We laugh at
what we do not believe. We say that an argument or an assertion that is
very absurd, is quite ludicrous. We laugh to show our satisfaction with
ourselves, or our contempt for those about us, or to conceal our envy
or our ignorance. We laugh at fools, and at those who pretend to be
wise&mdash;at extreme simplicity, awkwardness, hypocrisy, and affectation.”</p>
</div>

<p>A beautiful definition of the Disappointment Theory is Max Eastman’s,
“The experience of a forward motion of interest sufficiently definite
so that its ‘coming to nothing’ can be felt.”</p>

<p>Mr. Eastman says further:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is more like a reflex action than a mental result. It arises
in the very act of perception, when that act is brought to nothing
by two conflicting qualities of fact or feeling. It arises when
some numb habitual activity, suddenly obstructed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span> first appears in
consciousness with an announcement of its own failure. The blockage
of an instinct, a collision between two instincts, the interruption
of a habit, a ‘conflict of habit systems,’ a disturbed or misapplied
reflex&mdash;all these catastrophes, as well as the coming to nothing of an
effort at conceptual thought, must enter into the meaning of the word
<i>disappointment</i>, if it is to explain the whole field of practical
humor. The ‘strain’ in that expectation is what makes it capable of
humorous collapse. It is an active expectation. The feelings are
involved.”</p>
</div>

<p>The point of the Disappointment Theory, that of frustrating a carefully
built up expectation is exemplified in jests like these.</p>

<p>“Is your wife entertaining this winter?” asks one society man of
another. “Not very,” is the reply.</p>

<p>“I have to go to Brooklyn&mdash;” says a perplexed-looking old lady to a
traffic policeman. “Are you asking directions, ma’am, or just telling
me your troubles?”</p>

<p>The incongruity may be merely a collocution of words.</p>

<p>Mark Twain described Turner’s Slave Ship as “A tortoise-shell cat
having a fit in a platter of tomatoes.”</p>

<p>In a newspaper cartoon, a wife says to her husband, “Even if it is
Sunday morning and a terribly hot day, that’s no reason you should go
around looking like the dog’s breakfast!”</p>

<p>So we see the element of surprise must be combined with the element of
appropriate inappropriateness to gain the desired result.</p>

<p>In this story expectation is aroused for a human tragedy. The
incongruity and disappointment make its humor.</p>

<p>As Mr. Caveman was gnawing at a bone in his cave one morning, Mrs.
Caveman rushed in, exclaiming, “Quick! get your club! Oh, quick!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” growled Mr. Caveman.</p>

<p>“A sabre-toothed tiger is chasing mother!” gasped his wife.</p>

<p>Mr. Caveman uttered an expression of annoyance.</p>

<p>“And what the deuce do I care,” he said, “what happens to a
sabre-toothed tiger?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span></p>

<p>It must be admitted that a hard and fast line cannot be drawn between
the two theories given us by the Greek philosophers.</p>

<p>Cicero subscribed to the Derision theory, and said the ridiculous
rested on a certain meanness and deformity, and a joke to be pleasing
must be <i>on</i> somebody. But he declared, also, that the most
eminent kind of the ridiculous is that in which we expect to hear one
thing and hear another said.</p>

<p>Several other Greek and Roman philosophers tackled the subject without
adding anything of importance, and some of them, as well as later
writers declared that the comic could never be defined, but is to be
appreciated only by taste and natural discernment; while many moderns
agree that all theories are inadequate and contradictory, however
useful they may be for convenience in discussion.</p>

<p>Perhaps the trouble may be that only serious-minded people attempt a
definition of humor, and they are not the ones best fitted for the work.</p>

<p>For the discussion goes on still, and is as fascinating to some types
of mentality as is the question of perpetual motion or the Fountain of
Immortal Youth.</p>

<p>A useful commentary on the matter, and one appropriate at this juncture
is the following extract from the works of the celebrated theologian,
Dr. Isaac Barrow, an Englishman of the Seventeenth century.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It may be demanded,” says he, “what the thing we speak of is, and what
this facetiousness doth import; to which question I might reply, as
Democritus did to him that asked the definition of a man&mdash;<i>’Tis that
which we all see and know!</i> and one better apprehends what it is
by acquaintance, than I can inform him by description. It is indeed a
thing so versatile and multiform, appearing in so many shapes, so many
postures, so many garbs, so variously apprehended by several eyes and
judgments, that it seemeth no less hard to settle a clear and certain
notice thereof, than to make a portrait of Proteus, or to define the
figure of fleeting air. Sometimes it lieth in pat allusion to a known
story, or in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span> seasonable application of a trivial saying, or in forging
an apposite tale; sometimes it playeth in words and phrases, taking
advantage from the ambiguity of their sense, or the affinity of their
sound; sometimes it is wrapped in a dress of luminous expression;
sometimes it lurketh under an odd similitude. Sometimes it is lodged in
a sly question; in a smart answer; in a quirkish reason; in a shrewd
intimation; in cunningly diverting or cleverly restoring an objection;
sometimes it is couched in a bold scheme of speech; in a tart irony; in
a lusty hyperbole; in a startling metaphor; in a plausible reconciling
of contradictions; or in acute nonsense. Sometimes a scenical
representation of persons or things, a counterfeit speech, a mimical
look or gesture, passeth for it. Sometimes an affected simplicity,
sometimes a presumptuous bluntness, gives it being. Sometimes it riseth
only from a lucky hitting upon what is strange; sometimes from a crafty
wresting obvious matter to the purpose. Often it consisteth in one
knows not what, and springeth up one can hardly tell how. Its ways are
unaccountable and inexplicable, being answerable to the numberless
rovings of fancy and windings of language. It is, in short, a manner
of speaking out of the simple and plain way (such as reason teacheth
and knoweth things by), which by a pretty surprising uncouthness
in conceit or expression doth affect and amuse the fancy, showing
in it some wonder, and breathing some delight thereto. It raiseth
admiration, as signifying a nimble sagacity of apprehension, a special
felicity of invention, a vivacity of spirit, and reach of wit more
than vulgar; it seeming to argue a rare quickness of parts, that one
can fetch in remote conceits applicable; a notable skill that he can
dexterously accommodate them to a purpose before him; together with a
lively briskness of humour not apt to damp those sportful flashes of
imagination. Whence in Aristotle such persons are termed επιδéξιοι,
dexterous men, and ευτροποι, men of facile and versatile manners,
who can easily turn themselves to all things, or turn all things to
themselves. It also procureth delight, by gratifying curiosity with its
rareness or semblance of difficulty (as monsters, not for their beauty
but their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span> rarity&mdash;as juggling tricks, not for their use but their
abstruseness&mdash;are beheld with pleasure); by diverting the mind from its
road of serious thoughts; by instilling gaiety and airiness of spirit;
by provoking to such dispositions of spirit in way of emulation or
compliance; and by seasoning matter, otherwise distasteful or insipid,
with an unusual and thence grateful tang.”&mdash;<i>Barrow’s Works</i>,
Sermon 14.</p>
</div>

<p>Also in the Seventeenth century there sprang into being a definition
that has lived, possibly because of the apt wording of its phrase.</p>

<p>It is by Thomas Hobbes, who declared for the Derision Theory, but with
less sweetness and light than it had hitherto enjoyed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Sudden glory</i> is the passion which maketh those <i>Grimaces</i>
called <span class="smcap">Laughter</span>,” said Hobbes in the “Leviathan,” “and is
caused either by some sudden act of their own, that pleaseth them; or
by the apprehension of some deformed thing in another, by comparison
whereof they suddenly applaud themselves. And it is incident most to
them, that are conscious of the fewest abilities in themselves; who
are forced to keep themselves in their own favour, by observing the
imperfections of other men. And therefore much laughter at the defects
of others, is a signe of Pusillanimity. For of great minds, one of
the proper workes is, to help and free others from scorn; and compare
themselves onely with the most able.”</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">and, also from Hobbes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The passion of laughter is nothing else but <i>sudden glory</i>
arising from a sudden conception of some <i>eminency in ourselves</i>
by comparison with the infirmity of others, or with our own formerly:
for men laugh at the <i>follies</i> of themselves past, when they
come suddenly to remembrance, except they bring with them any present
dishonour.”&mdash;<i>Treatise on Human Nature</i>, chap. ix.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span></p>
</div>

<p>There is small doubt that the vogue of Hobbes’ definition of this
theory rests on the delightfully expressive, “Sudden Glory,” for those
two words beautifully picture the emotion caused by the unexpected
opportunity to laugh at the discomfiture of another.</p>

<p>Locke followed with a dry and meaningless dissertation, and Coleridge
wrote his discerning but all too brief remarks.</p>

<p>Many German writers gave profound if unimportant opinions.</p>

<p>Addison wrote pleasantly about it, and George Meredith, while accepting
the Derision Theory, modified its harshness thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If you believe that our civilization is founded in common-sense
(and it is the first condition of sanity to believe it), you will,
when contemplating men, discern a Spirit overhead; not more heavenly
than the light flashed upward from glassy surfaces, but luminous and
watchful; never shooting beyond them, nor lagging in the rear; so
closely attached to them that it may be taken for a slavish reflex,
until its features are studied. It has the sage’s brows, and the sunny
malice of a faun lurks at the corners of the half-closed lips drawn in
an idle wariness of half tension. That slim feasting smile, shaped like
the long-bow, was once a big round satyr’s laugh, that flung up the
brows like a fortress lifted by gunpowder. The laugh will come again,
but it will be of the order of the smile, finely tempered, showing
sunlight of the mind, mental richness rather than noisy enormity. Its
common aspect is one of unsolicitous observation, as if surveying a
full field and having leisure to dart on its chosen morsels without
any fluttering eagerness. Men’s future upon earth does not attract it;
their honesty and shapeliness in the present does; and whenever they
wax out of proportion, overblown, affected, pretentious, bombastical,
hypocritical, pedantic, fantastically delicate; whenever it sees them
self-deceived or hoodwinked, given to run riot in idolatries, drifting
into vanities, congregating in absurdities, planning shortsightedly,
plotting dementedly; whenever they are at variance with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span> their
professions, and violate the unwritten but perceptible laws binding
them in consideration one to another; whenever they offend sound
reason, fair justice; are false in humility or mined with conceit,
individually, or in the bulk&mdash;the Spirit overhead will look humanely
malign and cast an oblique light on them, followed by volleys of
silvery laughter. That is the Comic Spirit.”</p>
</div>

<p>With Kant, however, the other theory of Aristotle came into notice.
Kant declared, “Laughter is the affection arising from the sudden
transformation of a strained expectation into nothing.”</p>

<p>This was dubbed by Emerson, “Frustrated Expectation,” and describes the
Disappointment Theory as Sudden Glory describes the Derision Theory.</p>

<p>On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets of the
World of Humor.</p>

<p>There are many other theories and sub-theories, there are long and
prosy books written about them, but are outside our Outline.</p>

<p>A general understanding of the humorous element is all we are after and
that has now been set forth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A question closely akin to What is Humor? is What is a Sense of Humor?</p>

<p>The phrase seems self-explanatory, and is by no means identical with
the thing itself. Nor are the two inseparable. Humor and the sense of
humor need not necessarily lie in the same brain.</p>

<p>Two erudite writers on this subject have chosen to consider the phrase
as a unique bit of terminology.</p>

<p>Mr. Max Eastman says; “The creation of that name is the most original
and the most profound contribution of modern thought to the problem of
the comic.”</p>

<p>While Professor Brander Matthews says; “Ample as the English vocabulary
is today, it is sometimes strangely deficient in needful terms. Thus it
is that we have nothing but the inadequate phrase <i>sense of humor</i>
to denominate a quality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span> which is often confounded with humor itself,
and which should always be sharply discriminated from it.”</p>

<p>Now it would seem that the phrase was simply a matter of evolution,
coming along when the time was ripe. Surely it is no stroke of genius,
nor yet is it hopelessly inadequate.</p>

<p>It must be granted that a sense of the humorous is as logical a thought
as a sensitive ear for music, or, to be more strictly analogous, a
sense of moderation or that very definite thing, card sense.</p>

<p>Sense, used thus, is almost synonymous with taste, and a taste for
literature or for the Fine Arts in no way implies a productive faculty
in those fields. A taste for humor would mean precisely the same thing
as a sense of humor, and the taste or the sense may be more or less
natural and more or less cultivated, as in the matter of books or
pictures.</p>

<p>A taste for music is a sense of music, and one may appreciate and enjoy
music and its rendition to the utmost without being able to sing a note
or play upon any instrument whatever.</p>

<p>One may be a music critic or an art critic, or even a critic of
literature, without being able to create any of these things.</p>

<p>Why, then, put forth as a discovery that one may have a sense of humor
without being humorous and <i>vice versa</i>?</p>

<p>Humor is creative, while the sense of humor is merely receptive and
appreciative.</p>

<p>Many great humorists have little or no sense of humor. Try to tell
a joke to an accredited joker and note his blank expression of
uncomprehension. It is because he has no sense of humor that he takes
himself seriously.</p>

<p>Such was the case with Dickens, with Carlyle, with many renowned wits.
The humorist without the sense of humor is a bore. He tells long,
detailed yarns, proud of himself, and not seeing his hearers’ lack of
interest.</p>

<p>The man with a sense of humor is a joy to know and to be with.</p>

<p>The man who possesses both is already an immortal.</p>

<p>Now as the sense of humor is negative, recipient, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span> humor is
positive and creative, it follows that a sense of humor alone cannot
produce humorous literature.</p>

<p>These mute, inglorious Miltons, therefore, have no place in our
Outline, but they deserve a passing word of recognition for the
assistance they have been to the humorists, by way of being applauding
audiences.</p>

<p>For humor, like beauty is in the eye of the beholder. One with an
acute sense of humor will see comic in stones, wit in the running
brooks,&mdash;while a dull or absent sense of humor can see no fun save in
the obvious jest.</p>

<p>The lines,</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="ileft">“A jest’s prosperity lies in the ear</div>
        <div>Of him who hears it. Never in the tongue</div>
        <div>Of him who makes it.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">in <i>Love’s Labour’s Lost</i> proves that Shakespeare understood the
meaning and value of a sense of humor.</p>

<p>Although it was at a much later date that the word humor came to be
used as now, to mean a gentle, good-natured sort of fun.</p>

<p>All types of humor are universal and of all time. But the first
definitions were arrived at by the men of Greece and Rome, who were
scholarly and analytical, hence the hair-splitting and meticulous
efforts to treat it metaphysically.</p>

<p>Humor today rarely is used in a caustic or biting sense,&mdash;that is
reserved for wit.</p>

<p>Which brings us to another great and futile question,&mdash;the distinction
between wit and humor.</p>

<p>There is not time or space to take up this subject fully here. But we
can sum up the decisions and opinions of some few of the thinking minds
that have been bent upon it.</p>

<p>As the best and most comprehensive is the dissertation by William
Hazlitt, most of this is here given.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Humour is the describing the ludicrous as it is in itself; wit is the
exposing it, by comparing or contrasting it with something else. Humour
is, as it were, the growth of nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span> and accident; wit is the product
of art and fancy. Humour, as it is shown in books, is an imitation of
the natural or acquired absurdities of mankind, or of the ludicrous
in accident, situation, and character; wit is the illustrating and
heightening the sense of that absurdity by some sudden and unexpected
likeness or opposition of one thing to another, which sets off the
quality we laugh at or despise in a still more contemptible or striking
point of view. Wit, as distinguished from poetry, is the imagination
or fancy inverted and so applied to given objects, as to make the
little look less, the mean more light and worthless; or to divert
our admiration or wean our affections from that which is lofty and
impressive, instead of producing a more intense admiration and exalted
passion, as poetry does. Wit may sometimes, indeed, be shown in
compliments as well as satire; as in the common epigram&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="ileft">“‘Accept a miracle, instead of wit:</div>
        <div>See two dull lines with Stanhope’s pencil writ.’</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>But then the mode of paying it is playful and ironical, and contradicts
itself in the very act of making its own performance an humble foil
to another’s. Wit hovers round the borders of the light and trifling,
whether in matters of pleasure or pain; for as soon as it describes the
serious seriously, it ceases to be wit, and passes into a different
form. Wit is, in fact, the eloquence of indifference, or an ingenious
and striking exposition of those evanescent and glancing impressions
of objects which affect us more from surprise or contrast to the train
of our ordinary and literal preconceptions, than from anything in the
objects themselves exciting our necessary sympathy or lasting hatred.</p>

<p>“That wit is the most refined and effectual, which is founded on the
detection of unexpected likeness or distinction in things, rather than
in words.</p>

<p>“Wit is, in fact, a voluntary act of the mind, or exercise of the
invention, showing the absurd and ludicrous consciously, whether in
ourselves or another. Cross-readings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span> where the blunders are designed,
are wit; but if any one were to light upon them through ignorance or
accident, they would be merely ludicrous.</p>

<p>“Lastly, there is a wit of sense and observation, which consists in the
acute illustration of good sense and practical wisdom by means of some
far-fetched conceit or quaint imagery. The matter is sense, but the
form is wit. Thus the lines in Pope&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="ileft">“’Tis with our judgments as our watches, none</div>
        <div>Go just alike; yet each believes his own&mdash;’</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">are witty rather than poetical; because the truth they convey is a mere
dry observation on human life, without elevation or enthusiasm, and the
illustration of it is of that quaint and familiar kind that is merely
curious and fanciful.”</p>
</div>

<p>Thus Hazlitt: yet it is not necessary to be so verbose in the matter of
discriminating wit from humor.</p>

<p>They are intrinsically different though often outwardly alike.</p>

<p>Wit is intensive or incisive, while humor is expansive. Wit is rapid,
humor is slow. Wit is sharp, humor is gentle. Wit is intentional, humor
is fortuitous.</p>

<p>But to my mind the great difference lies in the fact that wit is
subjective while humor is objective.</p>

<p>Wit is the invention of the mind of its creator; humor lies in the
object that he observes. Wit originates in one’s self, humor outside
one’s self.</p>

<p>Again, wit is art, humor is nature. Wit is creative fancy, more or
less educated and skilled. Humor is found in a simple object, and is
unintentional.</p>

<p>Yet in these, as in all definitions, we must stretch a point when
necessary; we must make allowances for viewpoints and opinions, and we
must agree that the question is not one that may be answered by the
card.</p>

<p>Nor is it necessary in the present undertaking.</p>

<p><i>An Outline of Humor</i> is planned to include all sorts and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
conditions of fun, all types and distinctions of wit and humor from the
earliest available records, or deductions from records, down to the
dawn of the Twentieth Century.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Man has been defined as the animal capable of laughter. Although this
definition has been attacked by lovers of quadrupeds, it has held
in the minds of thinkers and students. Aristotle, Milton, Hazlitt,
Voltaire, Schopenhauer, Bergson and many other distinguished scholars
hold that the playfulness seen in animals is in no way an indication of
their sense of humor.</p>

<p>The Laughing Hyena and the Laughing Jackass are so called only because
their cry has a likeness to the sound of raucous human laughter, but it
is no result of mirthful feeling.</p>

<p>Hazlitt says man is the only animal that laughs and weeps, for he is
the only animal that is struck with the difference between what things
are and what they ought to be.</p>

<p>The playfulness of dogs or kittens is often assumed to be humor, when
it is mere imitative sagacity. The stolid, imperturbable gravity of
animals’ faces shows no appreciation of mirth.</p>

<p>Oliver Wendell Holmes speaks of the large brown eyes of oxen as
imperfect organisms, because they may show no sign of fun.</p>

<p>Yet it is, in a way, a matter of opinion, for the instinct of humor was
among the latest to evolve in the human race, and rudimentary hints of
it may be present in other animals as in our own children. A monkey
or a baby will show amusement when tickled, but this is mere physical
reflex action, and cannot be called a true sense of humor.</p>

<p>Many animal lovers assume intelligences in their pets that are mere
reflections of their own mental processes or are thoughts fathered by
their own wishes.</p>

<p>It is, however, of little importance, for however appreciative of fun
an animal may be, it cannot create or impart wit or humor, and most
certainly it cannot laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span></p>

<p>Bergson goes even farther. He declares the comic does not exist outside
the pale of what is strictly human.</p>

<p>He states: You may laugh at an animal, but only because you have
detected in it some human attitude or expression.</p>

<p>This is easily proved by the recollection of the fun of Puss In Boots
or The Three Bears, and the gravity of a Natural History.</p>

<p>Therefore, Bergson argues, man is not only the only animal that laughs,
he is the only animal which is laughed at, for if any other animal
or any lifeless object provokes mirth, it is only because of some
resemblance to man in appearance or intent.</p>

<p>So, with such minor exceptions as to be doubtful or negligible, we must
accept man as the only exponent or possessor of humor.</p>

<p>And it is one of the latest achievements of humanity.</p>

<p>First, we assent, was the survival of the fittest. Followed a sense
of hunger, a sense of safety, a sense of warfare, a sense of Tribal
Rights,&mdash;through all these stages there was no time or need for humor.</p>

<p>Among the earliest fossilized remains no funny bone has been found.</p>

<p>Doubtless, too, a sense of sorrow came before the sense of humor
dawned. Death came, and early man wept long before it occurred to him
to laugh and have the world laugh with him. Gregariousness and leisure
were necessary before mirth could ensue. All life was subjective;
dawning intelligence learned first to look out for Number One.</p>

<p>Yet it was early in the game that our primordial ancestors began to see
a lighter side of life.</p>

<p>Indeed, as Mr. Wells tells us, they mimicked very cleverly, gestured,
danced and laughed before they could talk!</p>

<p>And the consideration of the development of this almost innate human
sense is our present undertaking.</p>

<p>The matter falls easily,&mdash;almost too easily,&mdash;into three divisions.</p>

<p>Let us call them, Ancient, Middle and Modern.</p>

<p>This is perhaps not an original idea of division, but it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span> certainly
the best for a preliminary arrangement. And it may not be convenient to
stick religiously to consecutive dates; our progress may become logical
rather than chronological.</p>

<p>As to a general division, then, let us consider Ancient Humor as a
period from the very beginning down to the time of the Greeks. The
Middle Division to continue until about the time of Chaucer. And the
Modern Period from that time to the present.</p>

<h2>ANCIENT HUMOR</h2>
</div>

<p>After careful consideration of all available facts and theories of the
earliest mental processes of our race, we must come to the conclusion
that mirth had its origin in sorrow; that laughter was the direct
product of tears.</p>

<p>Nor are they even yet completely dissevered. Who has not laughed till
he cried? Who has not cried herself into hysterical laughter? All
theories of humor include an element of unhappiness; all joy has its
hint of pain.</p>

<p>And so, when our archæologists hold the mirror up to prehistoric
nature, we see among the earliest reflected pictures, a procession
or group of evolving humanity about to sacrifice human victims to
their monstrous superstitions and, withal, showing a certain festival
cheerfulness. Moreover, we note that they are fantastically dressed,
and wear horns and painted masks. Surely, the first glimmerings of a
horrid mirth are indubitably the adjunct of such celebrations.</p>

<p>Since we have reason to believe that man mimicked before he could
talk,&mdash;and, observing a baby, we have no difficulty in believing
this,&mdash;we readily believe that his earliest mimicries aroused a feeling
of amusement in his auditors, and as their applause stimulated him to
fresh effort, the ball was set rolling and the fun began.</p>

<p>From mimicry was born exaggeration and the horns and painted masks were
grotesque and mirth-provoking.</p>

<p>Yet were they also used to inculcate fear, and moreover had
significance as expressions of sorrow and woe.</p>

<p>Thus the emotions, at first, were rather inextricably intermingled, nor
are they yet entirely untangled and straightened out.</p>

<p>Not to inquire too closely into the vague stories of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span> prehistoric
men, not to differentiate too exactly between Cro-Magnards and
Grimaldis, we at least know a few things about the late Palæolithic
people, and one indicative fact is that they had a leaning toward paint.</p>

<p>They buried their dead after painting the body, and they also painted
the weapons and ornaments that were interred with him.</p>

<p>It is owing to this addiction to paint that scientists have been
enabled to learn so much of primordial life, for the pigments of black,
brown, red, yellow and white still endure in the caves of France and
Spain.</p>

<p>And, since it is known that they painted their own faces and bodies we
can scarce help deducing that they presented grotesque appearances and
moved their fellows to laughter.</p>

<p>But any earnest thinker or student is very likely to get out of his
subject what he brings to it, at least, in kind. And so, archæologists
and antiquarians, being of grave and serious nature, have found no fun
or humor in these early peoples,&mdash;perhaps, because they brought none to
their search.</p>

<p>It remains, therefore, for us to sift their findings, and see, if by a
good chance we may discover some traces of mirth among the evidential
remains of prehistoric man.</p>

<p>It would not be, of course, creative or even intentional humor, but
since we know he was a clever mimic, we must assume the appreciation of
his mimicry by his fellows.</p>

<p>Moreover, he was deeply impressed by his dreams, and it must have been
that some of those dreams were of a humorous nature.</p>

<p>We are told his mentality was similar to that of a bright little
contemporary boy of five. This theory would give him the power of
laughter at simple things and it seems only fair to assume that he
possessed it.</p>

<p>In the beginnings of humanity there was very close connection between
man and the animals. Not only did man kill and eat the other animals,
but he cultivated and bred them, he watched them and studied their
habits.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, not surprising that man’s earliest efforts at drawing
should represent animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span></p>

<p>The earliest known drawings, those of the Palæolithic men show the
bison, horse, ibex, cave bear and reindeer. The drawing at first was
primitive, but later it became astonishingly clever and life-like.</p>

<p>Also, among these primitive peoples, there was some attempt at
sculpture, in the way of little stone or ivory statuettes. These
incline to caricature, and are probably the first dawning of that
tendency of the human brain.</p>

<p>Yet the accounts of these earliest men show little that can be
definitely styled humorous, and while we cannot doubt they possessed
a sense of mirth, they have left us scant traces of it, or else the
solemn archæologists have overlooked such.</p>

<p>The latter may be the case, for a scholar with a sense of humor, Thomas
Wright, declares as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A tendency to burlesque and caricature appears, indeed, to be a
feeling deeply implanted in human nature, and it is one of the earliest
talents displayed by people in a rude state of society. An appreciation
of, and sensitiveness to, ridicule, and a love of that which is
humorous, are found even among savages, and enter largely into their
relations with their fellow men. When, before people cultivated either
literature or art, the chieftain sat in his rude hall surrounded by his
warriors, they amused themselves by turning their enemies and opponents
into mockery, by laughing at their weaknesses, joking on their defects,
whether physical or mental, and giving them nicknames in accordance
therewith,&mdash;in fact, caricaturing them in words, or by telling stories
which were calculated to excite laughter. When the agricultural slaves
(for the tillers of the land were then slaves) were indulged with a
day of relief from their labours, they spent it in unrestrained mirth.
And when these same people began to erect permanent buildings, and
to ornament them, the favourite subjects of their ornamentation were
such as presented ludicrous ideas. The warrior, too, who caricatured
his enemy in his speeches over the festive board, soon sought to give
a more permanent form to his ridicule, which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span> endeavoured to do by
rude delineations on the bare rock, or on any other convenient surface
which presented itself to his hand. Thus originated caricature and
the grotesque in art. In fact, art itself, in its earliest forms, is
caricature; for it is only by that exaggeration of features which
belongs to caricature, that unskilful draughtsmen could make themselves
understood.”</p>
</div>

<p>An early development of humor was seen in the recognition of the fool
or buffoon.</p>

<p>It is not impossible that this arose because of the discovery or
invention of intoxicating drinks.</p>

<p>This important date is set, not very definitely, somewhere between
10,000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and 2,000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Its noticeable results
were merriment and feast-making. At these feasts the fool, who was not
yet a wit, won the laughter of the guests by his idiocy, or, often by
his deformity. The wise fool is a later development.</p>

<p>But at these feasts also appeared the bards or rhapsodists, who
entertained the company by chanting or reciting stories and jokes.</p>

<p>These are called the artists of the ear as the rock painters are
called the artists of the eye. And with them language grew in beauty
and power. They were living books, the only books then extant. For
writing came slowly and was a clumsy affair at best for a long period.
The Bards sang and recited and so kept alive folk-tales and jests that
remain to this day.</p>

<p>Writing, like most of the inventions of man served every other purpose
before that of humor.</p>

<p>At first it was only for accounts and matters of fact. In Egypt it was
used for medical recipes and magic formulas. Accounts, letters, name
lists and itineraries followed; but for the preservation of humorous
thought writing was not used. That was left to the bards, and of
course, to the caricaturists.</p>

<p>Therefore, Egyptian art usually presents itself in solemn and dignified
effects with no lightness or gayety implied.</p>

<p>Yet we are told by Sir Gardner Wilkinson, the early Egyptian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span> artists
cannot always conceal their natural tendency to the humorous, which
creeps out in a variety of little incidents. Thus, in a series of grave
historical pictures on one of the great monuments at Thebes, we find
a representation of a wine party, where the company consists of both
sexes, and which evidently shows that the ladies were not restricted
in the use of the juice of the grape in their entertainments; and,
as he adds, “the painters, in illustrating this fact, have sometimes
sacrificed their gallantry to a love of caricature.” Among the females,
evidently of rank, represented in this scene, “some call the servants
to support them as they sit, others with difficulty prevent themselves
from falling on those behind them, and the faded flower, which is ready
to drop from their heated hands, is intended to be characteristic of
their own sensations.” Sir Gardner observes that “many instances of
a talent for caricature, are observable in the compositions of the
Egyptian artists, who executed the paintings of the tombs at Thebes,
which belong to a very early period of the Egyptian annals. Nor is the
application of this talent restricted always to secular subjects, but
we see it at times intruding into the most sacred mysteries of their
religion.”</p>

<p>A class of caricatures which dates from a very remote period, shows
comparisons between men and the particular animals whose qualities they
possess.</p>

<p>As brave as a lion, as faithful as a dog, as sly as a fox or as
swinish as a pig,&mdash;these things are all represented in these ancient
caricatures.</p>

<p>More than a thousand years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> there was drawn on an Egyptian
papyrus a cat carrying a shepherd’s crook and driving a flock of geese.
This is but one section of a long picture, in which the animals are
often shown treating their human tyrants in the manner they are usually
treated by them.</p>

<p>All sorts of animals are shown, in odd contortions and grotesque
attitudes, and not infrequently the scene or episode depicted refers to
the state or condition of the human soul after death.</p>

<p>It is deduced that from these animal pictures arose the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span> class
of stories called fables, in which animals are endued with human
attributes.</p>

<p>And also connected with them is the belief in metempsychosis or the
transmission of the human soul into the body of an animal after death,
which is a strong factor in the primitive religions.</p>

<p>Indeed, the intermingling of humans and animals is inherent in all art
and literature, as, instance the calling of Our Lord a Lamb, or the
Holy Ghost, a Dove.</p>

<p>Or, as to this day we call our children lambs or kittens, or, slangily,
kids. As we still call a man an ass or a puppy; or a woman, a cat.</p>

<p>An argument for evolution can perhaps be seen in the inevitable turning
back to the animals for a description or representation of human types.</p>

<p>At any rate, early man used this sort of humor almost exclusively, and
so combined it with his serious thought, even his religions, that it
was a permanently interwoven thread.</p>

<p>And the exaggeration of this mimicry of animals resulted in the
grotesque and from that to the monstrous, as the mind grew with what it
fed on, and caricature developed and progressed.</p>

<p>Also, a subtler demonstration of dawning wit and humor is seen in the
deliberate and intentional burlesque of one picture by another.</p>

<p>In the British Museum is an Egyptian papyrus showing a lion and a
unicorn playing chess, which is a caricature of a picture frequently
seen on ancient monuments. And in the Egyptian collection of the New
York Historical Society there is a slab of limestone, dating back three
thousand years, which depicts a lion, seated upon a throne as king. To
him, a fox, caricaturing a High Priest, offers a goose and a fan. This,
too, is a burlesque of a serious picture.</p>

<p>Again, a lion is engaged in laying out the dead body of another animal,
and a hippopotamus is washing his hands in a water jar.</p>

<p>One of these burlesque pictures shows a soul doomed to return to its
earthly home in the form of a pig. This picture,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span> of such antiquity
that it deeply impressed the Greeks and Romans, is part of the
decoration of a king’s tomb.</p>

<p>The ancient Egyptians, it may be gathered from their humorous pictures,
were not averse to looking on the wine when it was red. Several
delineations of Egyptian servants carrying home their masters after a
carouse, are graphic and convincing; while others, equally so, show
the convivial ones dancing, standing on their heads or belligerently
wrestling.</p>

<p>The tombs of the ancient Egyptians abound in these representations of
over-merry occasions, and it all goes to prove the close connection in
the primitive mind of the emotions of grief and mirth.</p>

<p>Yet, <i>The Book of the Dead</i> that monument of Egyptian literature,
and the oldest in the world, contains only records of conquests and
a few stories and moral sayings,&mdash;not a trace of humor. That, in
ancient Egypt is represented solely by the ready and deft pencil of the
caricaturist.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Though humor came to them later, the earliest records of the Eastern
and Oriental countries show little or no traces of the comic.</p>

<p>Indeed eminent authorities state that there is not a single element of
the amusing in the art or literature of the Babylonians or Assyrians.
It may be that the eminent authorities hadn’t a nose for nonsense, or
the statement may be true. We never shall know.</p>

<p>But both these peoples had great skill in drawing and sculpture, and
though their records are chiefly historical or religious, we cannot
help feeling there may have been some jesting at somebody’s expense.</p>

<p>However, there are no existing records of any sort, and we fear
the ancient Assyrians and Babylonians must go down in history as
serious-minded folk.</p>

<p>The Hebrews show up much better.</p>

<p>In recent years Renan and Carlyle both declared the Jewish race
possessed no sense of humor, but their opinions probably reflected
their own viewpoint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span></p>

<p>For the early examples of Hebrew Satire and Parody are distinctly
humorous both in intent and in effect.</p>

<p>Parody is, of course, the direct outcome of the primeval passion for
mimicry. The first laugh-provoker was no doubt an exaggerated imitation
of some defect or peculiarity of another. And the development of the
art of amusement took centuries to get past that preliminary thought.</p>

<p>The tendency to imitation was the impetus that turned the religious
hymns into ribaldry and wine-songs, and the religious or funeral
festivals into orgies of grotesque masquerading.</p>

<p>And Hebrew literature is renowned for its parodies of serious matters
both of church and state.</p>

<p>With this race, satire sprang from parody and grew and thrived rapidly.</p>

<p>To quote from the learned Professor Chotzner:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Since the birth of Hebrew literature, many centuries ago, satire
has been one of its many characteristics. It is directed against the
foibles and follies of the miser, the hypocrite, the profligate, the
snob. The dull sermonizer, who puts his congregation to sleep, fares
badly, and even the pretty wickednesses of the fair sex do not escape
the hawk-eye of the Hebrew satirist. The luxury and extravagance of
the ‘Daughters of Zion’ were attacked by no less a person than Isaiah
himself; but human nature, especially that of a feminine kind, was too
strong even for so eminent a prophet as he was, and there is no reason
to suppose that the lady of those days wore one trinket the less in
deference to his invective.</p>

<p>“There are, in fact, several incidents mentioned here and there in the
pages of the Bible, which are decidedly of a satirical nature. Most
prominent among them are the two that refer respectively to Bileam,
who was sermonized by his ass, and to Haman who, as the Prime Minister
of Persia, had to do homage publicly to Mordecai, the very man whom he
greatly hated and despised. Nay, we are told, that, by the irony of
fate, Haman himself ended his life on the exceptionally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span> huge gallows
which, while in a humorous turn of mind, he had ordered to be erected
for the purpose of having executed thereon the object of his intense
hatred.</p>

<p>“And again, there are two excellent satires to be found respectively in
the 14th chapter of Isaiah, and in the 18th chapter of the 1st Book of
Kings. In the first, one of the mighty Babylonian potentates is held
up to derision, on account of the ignominious defeat he had sustained
in his own dominions, after he had been for a long time a great terror
to contemporary nations, living in various parts of the ancient world.
Even the trees of the forests are represented there as having mocked
at his fall, saying: ‘Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up
against us.’ In the second satire, the false prophets of Baal are
ridiculed by Elijah for having maimed their bodies, in order to do
thereby honour to a deity which is sometimes sarcastically referred to
in the Bible as being ‘the god of flies.’</p>

<p>“Delightfully satirical are also the two fables quoted in the Bible in
connection with <i>Jotham</i> and <i>Nathan</i>, the Prophet. These are
commonly well-known, and no extracts from them need be given here.</p>

<p>“The satirical turn of mind manifested by Hebrew writers living in
Biblical times, has been transmitted by them as a legacy to their
descendants, who flourished in subsequent ages down to the present day.
The first among them was Ben Sira who, in 180 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, wrote a
book, some of the contents of which are satirical, for there the vanity
of contemporary women, and the arrogance of some of the rich in the
community are ridiculed with mild sarcasm.</p>

<p>“But much more keen was the sense of the satirical that was possessed
by some of the ancient Rabbis, who were among those that brought into
existence the vast and interesting Talmudical literature. One of their
satires, called ‘Tithes,’ runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“In Palestine there once lived a widow with her two daughters, whose
only worldly possessions consisted of a little field. When she began to
plough it, a Jewish official quoted to her the words of the lawgiver
Moses: ‘Thou shalt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span> not plough with ox and ass together.’ When she
began to sow, she was admonished in the words of the same lawgiver not
to sow the fields with two kinds of seed. When she began to reap and
pile up the stacks, she was told that she must leave ‘gleanings,’ the
poor man’s sheaf, and the ‘corner.’</p>

<p>“When the harvest time came, she was informed that it was her duty to
give the priest’s share, consisting of the first and second ‘tithes.’
She quietly submitted, and gave what was demanded of her. Then she sold
the field, and bought two young ewes, in order that she might use their
wool, and profit by their offspring. But, as soon as the ewes gave
birth to their young, a priest came, and quoted to her the words of
Moses: ‘Give <i>me</i> the first-born, for so the Lord hath ordained.’
Again she submitted, and gave him the young.</p>

<p>“When the time of shearing came, the priest again made his appearance,
and said to her that, according to the Law, she was obliged to give him
‘the shoulder, the two cheeks, and the maw.’</p>

<p>“In a moment of despair, the widow said: ‘Let all the animals be
consecrated to the Lord!’ ‘In that case,’ answered the priest,
‘they belong altogether to me; for the Lord hath said: “Everything
consecrated in Israel shall be thine.”’ So, he took the sheep, and went
his way, leaving the widow and her two daughters in great distress, and
bathed in tears!”</p>
</div>


<h4><i>A WIFE’S RUSE</i><br />
<span class="subhed2">(A Rabbinical Tale)</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There is a Rabbinical law which makes it obligatory upon every Jewish
husband to divorce his wife, if after ten years of married life she
shall remain childless. Now, there once lived in an Oriental town a
man and his wife who were greatly attached to each other, but who
had, unfortunately, no children, though they had been married for a
considerable time.</p>

<p>“When the end of the tenth year of their marriage was approaching,
they both went to the Rabbi, and asked him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span> for his advice. The Rabbi
listened with great sympathy, but declared his inability to alter or
modify the law in their favour. The only suggestion, he said, that he
could make, was, that on the last night before their final separation,
they should celebrate a little feast together, and that the wife should
take some keepsake from her husband which would be a permanent token of
her husband’s unchangeable affection for her.</p>

<p>“Thus, on the last night, the wife prepared a sumptuous meal for the
two of them, and, amidst much merriment and laughter, she filled and
refilled her husband’s goblet with sparkling wine. Under its influence,
he fell into a heavy sleep, and while in this condition, he was carried
by his wife’s orders to her father’s abode, where he continued to
sleep till the following morning. When he awoke, and was wondering at
his strange surroundings, his cunning wife came smilingly into the
room, and said: ‘Of, my dear husband, I have actually carried out the
Rabbi’s suggestion, inasmuch as I have taken away from home a most
precious keepsake. This is your own dear self, without whom it would be
impossible for me to live.’</p>

<p>“The husband, moved to tears, embraced her most affectionately, and
promised that they should live together to the end. Thereupon they
joyfully returned home, and, going again to the Rabbi, they told him
what had happened, and asked him for his forgiveness and blessing,
which he readily accorded them. And, indeed, the Rabbi’s blessing
had an excellent result. For after the lapse of some time, they both
enjoyed the happiness of fondling a bright little child of their own.”</p>
</div>

<p>Arabian and Turkish thought and speech seem to be tinged with the sense
of the bizarre and strange rather than the grotesque. Their earliest
folk tales and pleasant stories, from which later grew the <i>Arabian
Nights</i>, form a cumulative, though broken chain from ancient to
modern times.</p>

<p>Persian humor leans toward the romantic and sentimental, but no ancient
fragments are available. From the later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span> writers, as Omar and Sadi, we
feel convinced there was an early literature but we can find none to
quote.</p>

<p>India shows the oldest and most definite signs of early folk lore and
retold tales.</p>

<p>Buddha’s <i>Jatakas</i> produced the stories that later proved the
germs of merry tales by Boccaccio and Chaucer. That these later writers
put in all the fun is not entirely probable.</p>

<p>Some antiquarians claim to find humor in the hymns of the Rig Vedas,
whose date is indefinitely put at between 2,000 and 1,500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
while others of different temperament deny it.</p>

<p>From this example the reader may judge for himself.</p>

   <h4><i>THE HYMN OF THE FROGS</i></h4>
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="ileft">“When the first shower of the rainy season</div>
        <div>Has fallen on them, parched with thirst and longing,</div>
        <div>In glee each wet and dripping frog jumps upward;</div>
        <div>The green one and the speckled join their voices.</div>

        <div>When they perform their annual devotions:</div>
        <div>Like priests at service sweating o’er the kettle,</div>
        <div>They issue forth; not one remains in hiding.</div>

<p>The <i>Jatakas</i> of Buddha, though religious writings, and teachings
by parables, are not without humor. The one about the silly son who
killed the mosquito on his father’s bald head with a heavy blow of an
ax, has its funny side. Or the old monarch who had reigned 252,000
years and still had 84,000 years more ahead of him, and went into
solitary retirement because he discovered a gray hair in his head.
Another shrewd fellow made an enormous fortune out of the sale of a
dead mouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span></p>

<p>Of course, the animals figure largely. There is the tale of the monkeys
who watered a garden and then pulled up the plants to see if their
roots were wet, and the angry crows who tried to drink up the sea.</p>

<p>Riddles, too, must be remembered.</p>

<p>Though not many specimens have been preserved, yet we remember Samson’s
riddle, so disastrous to the Philistines.</p>

<p>“Out of the eater came forth meat; and out of the strong came forth
sweetness.”</p>

<p>And when his susceptibility to cajolery led him to tell his wife the
answer, and she tattled, his comment was the pithy; “If ye had not
plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.”</p>

<p>The Sphinx’s riddle is well known. “What animal goes on four legs in
the morning, on two at noon, and on three at night?”</p>

<p>The answer being: Man, who goes on all-fours in infancy, walks upright
in middle life, and adds a staff in old age.</p>

<p>An ancient riddle is ascribed to the problematical personality of
Homer, though it was doubtless originated before his time,&mdash;if he had a
time.</p>

<p>Homer, the tale goes, met some boys coming home from a fishing trip. On
his asking them of their luck, they replied, “What we caught we threw
away; what we didn’t catch, we have.”</p>

<p>It seems they referred to fleas, not fish, and his inability to guess
this so enraged Homer, that he killed himself.</p>

<p>And here is a free translation of an ancient Arabian riddle.</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="ileft">“The loftiest cedars I can eat,</div>

        <div>I storm whene’er you give me meat,</div>
        <div class="i1">Whene’er you give me drink, I die.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>The answer is Fire, and as may be seen, the type of riddle is precisely
such as are found in the puzzle columns of today’s papers.</p>

<p>Riddles are frequently mentioned in Ancient Literature,&mdash;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span> every
country or race indulging in them. Josephus tells us that Solomon and
Hiram of Tyre were in the habit of exchanging riddles.</p>

<p>So we find that a love of fun or playfulness was inherent in our early
ancestors, yet it did not reach a height to be called genuine creative
humor.</p>

<p>But there is always the feeling that if more of the translators
themselves possessed more humor, they might find more in the originals.</p>

<p>As a rule, translators and antiquarian researchers are so engaged in
serious seeking that they would probably pass over humor if they ran
across it.</p>

<p>When a man is prospecting for iron or coal, he may easily be blind to
indications of wells of natural oil.</p>

<p>More wit and humor of Ancient India has come down to us through the
caricatures and grotesque drawings than in words.</p>

<p>The innumerable pictures of the God Krishna are the most humorous of
these.</p>

<p>Krishna appears to have been a veritable Don Juan, and his multitude of
lady friends numbered up to many thousands.</p>

<p>It is narrated that a friend of his, who had no wife, begged for just
one from Krishna’s multiplicity.</p>

<p>“Court any one you wish,” said the light-hearted god, pleasantly.</p>

<p>So the friend went from house to house of Krishna’s various wives, but
one and all, they declared themselves quite satisfied with husband,
Krishna, and moreover each one was convinced that he was hers alone.
The seeker visited sixteen thousand and eight houses, and then gave it
up.</p>

<p>The endless pictures of Krishna represent him surrounded by lovely
ladies, and a curious detail of these drawings is that in many
instances the group of girls is wreathed and twisted into the shape
or semblance of a bird or a horse or an elephant, presenting an
interesting and not unpleasing effect.</p>

<p>Now, all we have given so far, seems indeed a meager grist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span> for the
first division of our Outline. But one may not find what does not exist.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that humor was known and loved from the dawning
of independent thought, but as it was not recorded, save for a few
drawings, on the enduring rocks, it died with its originators.</p>

<p>Humor was the last need of a self-providing race, and even when found
it was a luxury rather than a necessity.</p>

<p>As a fair example of the earliest tales that have lived in various
forms ever since their first recital, is appended the bit of ancient
Hindoo folk-lore, called</p>


<h4><i>THE GOOD WIFE AND THE BAD HUSBAND</i></h4>

<p>In a secluded village there lived a rich man, who was very miserly,
and his wife, who was very kind-hearted and charitable, but a stupid
little woman that believed everything she heard. And there lived in
the same village a clever rogue, who had for some time watched for an
opportunity for getting something from this simple woman during her
husband’s absence. So one day, when he had seen the old miser ride
out to inspect his lands, this rogue of the first water came to the
house, and fell down at the threshold as if overcome by fatigue. The
woman ran up to him at once and inquired whence he came. “I am come
from Kailása,” said he; “having been sent down by an old couple living
there, for news of their son and his wife.” “Who are those fortunate
dwellers in Siva’s mountain?” she asked. And the rogue gave the names
of her husband’s deceased parents, which he had taken good care, of
course, to learn from the neighbours. “Do you really come from them?”
said the simple woman. “Are they doing well there? Dear old people!
How glad my husband would be to see you, were he here! Sit down,
please, and rest until he returns. How do they live there? Have they
enough to eat and dress themselves withal?” These and a hundred other
questions she put to the rogue, who, for his part, wished to get away
as soon as possible, knowing full well how he would be treated if
the miser should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span> return while he was there. So he replied, “Mother,
language has no words to describe the miseries they are undergoing in
the other world. They have not a rag of clothing, and for the last six
days they have eaten nothing, and have lived on water only. It would
break your heart to see them.” The rogue’s pathetic words deceived the
good woman, who firmly believed that he had come down from Kailása, a
messenger from the old couple to herself! “Why should they so suffer,”
said she, “when their son has plenty to eat and clothe himself withal,
and when their daughter-in-law wears all sorts of costly garments?”
So saying, she went into the house, and soon came out again with two
boxes containing all her own and her husband’s clothes, which she
handed to the rogue, desiring him to deliver them to the poor old
couple in Kailása. She also gave him her jewel-box, to be presented to
her mother-in-law. “But dress and jewels will not fill their hungry
stomachs,” said the rogue. “Very true; I had forgot: wait a moment,”
said the simple woman, going into the house once more. Presently
returning with her husband’s cash chest, she emptied its glittering
contents into the rogue’s skirt, who now took his leave in haste,
promising to give everything to the good old couple in Kailása; and
having secured all the booty in his upper garment, he made off at the
top of his speed as soon as the silly woman had gone indoors.</p>

<p>Shortly after this the husband returned home, and his wife’s pleasure
at what she had done was so great that she ran to meet him at the door,
and told him all about the arrival of the messenger from Kailása, how
his parents were without clothes and food, and how she had sent them
clothes and jewels and store of money. On hearing this, the anger of
the husband was great; but he checked himself, and inquired which road
the messenger from Kailása had taken, saying that he wished to follow
him with a further message for his parents. So she very readily pointed
out the direction in which the rogue had gone. With rage in his heart
at the trick played upon his stupid wife, he rode off in hot haste,
and after having proceeded a considerable distance, he caught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span> sight
of the flying rogue, who, finding escape hopeless, climbed up into a
<i>pipal</i> tree. The husband soon reached the foot of the tree, when
he shouted to the rogue to come down. “No, I cannot,” said he; “this
is the way to Kailása,” and then climbed to the very top of the tree.
Seeing there was no chance of the rogue coming down, and there being
no one near to whom he could call for help, the old miser tied his
horse to a neighbouring tree, and began to climb up the <i>pipal</i>
himself. When the rogue observed this, he thanked all his gods most
fervently, and having waited until his enemy had climbed nearly up to
him, he threw down his bundle of booty, and then leapt nimbly from
branch to branch till he reached the ground in safety, when he mounted
the miser’s horse and with his bundle rode into a thick forest, where
he was not likely to be discovered. Being thus balked the miser came
down the <i>pipal</i> tree slowly, cursing his own stupidity in having
risked his horse to recover the things which his wife had given the
rogue, and returned home at leisure. His wife, who was waiting his
return, welcomed him with a joyous countenance, and cried, “I thought
as much: you have sent away your horse to Kailása, to be used by your
old father.” Vexed at his wife’s words, as he was, he replied in the
affirmative, to conceal his own folly.</p>

<h2>MIDDLE DIVISION</h2>
</div>


<h3>PART I<br />
<span class="subhed">GREECE</span></h3>

<p>In essaying an Outline of the World’s Humor, the greatest obstacle to
our work is the insufficiency of data.</p>

<p>While we are sure there was humor in the early days, we cannot get much
of it for publication. The Fables and Folk Tales that come down to us
are of uncertain origin and date. Traditions have been traced to their
inception but the tracery is of vague and shadowy lines.</p>

<p>Wherefore it is well nigh impossible to formulate or systematize our
chronology.</p>

<p>The simple division of Ancient, Middle and Modern must serve for a main
arrangement, with the subdivision of the Middle into Greece, Rome, and
the Mediæval Ages.</p>

<p>Greece will include generally the time from 500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> to
500 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, although its traditions reach farther back into
antiquity.</p>

<p>The whole Middle Division must include all from 500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> to
about 1300 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span></p>

<p>So, we see the boundaries are inevitable if not entirely satisfactory.</p>

<p>Greece was the primeval European civilization, and in the year 500
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> it already had its own literature and the Iliad and
Odyssey were even then antique.</p>

<p>These, at this time, were traditionally ascribed to Homer as they have
ever since remained. But Homer’s individual existence is a matter of
doubt, and his history and personality are as unknown as those of the
ancient patriarchs of the Old Testament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span></p>

<p>Even from this distant viewpoint the humor of antiquity is, like
beauty, in the eye of the beholder.</p>

<p>Coleridge says definitely, “Amongst the classic ancients there was
little or no humor.” But, on the other hand, that eminent antiquarian,
William Hayes Ward says, “The Greeks were the maddest, jolliest race of
men that ever inhabited our planet. As they loved games and play, they
loved the joke.”</p>

<p>So, as more than any other human emotion, humor is a matter of
opinion, we must dig up whatever nuggets we can and not assay them too
meticulously.</p>

<p>Like Homer, Æsop, is wrapped in mystery. Like Homer, too, various
cities claimed the honor of being his birthplace. The truth is not
known.</p>

<p>Tradition places Æsop in the sixth century, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and makes him
a dwarf and, originally, a slave.</p>

<p>Though probably not a historic personage, his name is inseparably
connected with the Fables that have been known to us for centuries;
and, according to scholars, some of them were known a thousand years
earlier to the Egyptians.</p>

<p>Of these things we cannot speak positively, but <i>Æsop’s Fables</i>
certainly come at or near the beginnings of Greek Literature, and their
place is here.</p>


<h4>ÆSOP’S FABLES</h4>

<h5><i>THE LION, THE BEAR, THE MONKEY, AND THE FOX</i></h5>

<p>The Tyrant of the forest issued a proclamation, commanding all his
subjects to repair immediately to his royal den. Among the rest, the
Bear made his appearance; but pretending to be offended with the steams
which issued from the Monarch’s apartments, he was imprudent enough
to hold his nose in his Majesty’s presence. This insolence was so
highly resented, that the Lion in a rage laid him dead at his feet.
The Monkey, observing what had passed, trembled for his carcass; and
attempted to conciliate favor by the most abject flattery. He began
with protesting, that for his part he thought the apartments were
perfumed with Arabian spices; and exclaiming against the rudeness of
the Bear, admired the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span> beauty of his Majesty’s paws, so happily formed,
he said, to correct the insolence of clowns. This fulsome adulation,
instead of being received as he expected, proved no less offensive
than the rudeness of the Bear; and the courtly Monkey was in like
manner extended by the side of Sir Bruin. And now his Majesty cast his
eye upon the Fox. “Well, Reynard,” said he, “and what scent do you
discover here?” “Great Prince,” replied the cautious Fox, “my nose was
never esteemed my most distinguishing sense; and at present I would
by no means venture to give my opinion, as I have unfortunately got a
terrible cold.”</p>


<h6><i>Reflection</i></h6>

<p>It is often more prudent to suppress our sentiments, than either to
flatter or to rail.</p>


<h5><i>THE PARTIAL JUDGE</i></h5>

<p>A Farmer came to a neighbouring Lawyer, expressing great concern for an
accident which he said had just happened. “One of your oxen,” continued
he, “has been gored by an unlucky bull of mine, and I shall be glad
to know how I am to make you a reparation.” “Thou art a very honest
fellow,” replied the Lawyer, “and wilt not think it unreasonable that
I expect one of thy oxen in return.” “It is no more than justice,”
quoth the Farmer, “to be sure: but what did I say!&mdash;I mistake&mdash;It is
your bull that has killed one of my oxen.” “Indeed,” says the Lawyer,
“that alters the case: I must inquire into the affair; and if”&mdash;“And
<i>if</i>!” said the Farmer, “the business I find would have been
concluded without an <i>if</i>, had you been as ready to do justice to
others as to exact it from them.”</p>


<h6><i>Reflection</i></h6>

<p>The injuries we do, and those we suffer, are seldom weighed in the same
scales.</p>

<p>It is all very well for some wiseacres to say, “Humor came in with
civilization,” for others to say, “Humor took its rise in the Middle
Ages,” or to set any other arbitrary time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span></p>

<p>The truth is that Humor, is an innate emotion, and in a general sense,
it is the child of religion.</p>

<p>The primitive religions were conducted with Festival Ceremonies, whose
celebrations were of such symbolic nature, and later, such burlesque of
symbolism that gaiety ensued and then ribaldry.</p>

<p>The worship of the god Dionysus,&mdash;later mixed up in tradition with
Bacchus,&mdash;was responsible for much reckless license that was the
earliest form of comedy.</p>

<p>Dionysus, being deity of the vineyard, as well as of phallic worship,
lent himself readily to the grotesque representations and hysterical
orgies of his followers and Greek Comedy was probably the outcome of
this.</p>

<p>In these Dionysiac festivals the processions and parades represented
everything imaginable that was bizarre or ridiculous.</p>

<p>As in all ages, before and since, the mummers clothed themselves in the
likeness of animals, and invented horrible masks.</p>

<p>Comedy came to be abuse, ridicule and parody of sacred things.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Coleridge’s comment, laughter was universal in Greece
and Plato declared the <i>agelastoi</i> or non-laughers to be the least
respectable of mortals.</p>

<p>Small wonder then that their mirth exhibited itself in drawings and
paintings. These mediums were easier to come by than writings, and the
early grotesques and caricatures of the Greeks are drawings on Greek
vases which show the playfulness as well as the serious purpose of
the artist-potter. The first and greatest of Greek poets adds strokes
of wit to his stories of the Trojan war. When Ulysses returns from
the siege of Ilium he stops at the island of Sicily, and he and his
companions are caught by the one-eyed giant Polyphemus and imprisoned
in his cave. Then comes the story of the crafty leader’s escape, after
some of his companions had been slain and eaten by the monster. It
is a most amusing story, told with all Greek humor, how the giant
was blinded with the burnt stick which gouged out his eye while in a
drunken sleep; how the Greeks escaped through the entrance by clinging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
under the bodies of his sheep, while he felt of them one by one to see
that not a Greek escaped. Then comes the giant’s howling call to his
distant companions, and in answer to their question, who had blinded
him, his telling them that “Outis” (Nobody) had done it, <i>Outis</i>
(<i>Nobody</i>) being the name Ulysses had given the giant as his own.
“If nobody has done it”, replied his companions, “then it is the act of
the gods”, and they left him to endure his loss. Thus the Greeks escape
to their ships and taunt the monster as they flee away, followed by his
vain pursuit. Homer relieves the wisdom of Ulysses and the dignity of
Agamemnon with the gibes of Thersites or the rude humor of the suitors
of Penelope, the trick of whose embroidery is itself an amusing story.</p>

<p>Greece, of course, was the cradle of all that we now call art.
Landscape painters, painters of animals and portrait limners, as well
as still life artists and sculptors and workers in mosaics reached a
high state of perfection.</p>

<p>Then naturally the caricaturists and comic artists could not be wanting
there. Burlesque affected their pencils and brushes as it had their
speech and caricature and parody were rampant.</p>

<p>A marvelous example is the parody or caricature of the Oracle of
Apollo at Delphi. It is taken from an oxybaphon which was brought from
the Continent to England, where it passed into the collection of Mr.
William Hope. The <i>oxybaphon</i>, or, as it was called by the Romans,
<i>acetabulum</i>, was a large vessel for holding vinegar, which formed
one of the important ornaments of the table, and was therefore very
susceptible of pictorial embellishment of this description. It is
one of the most remarkable Greek caricatures of this kind yet known,
and represents a parody on one of the most interesting stories of
the Grecian mythology, that of the arrival of Apollo at Delphi. The
artist, in his love of burlesque, has spared none of the personages who
belonged to the story. The Hyperborean Apollo himself appears in the
character of a quack doctor, on his temporary stage, covered by a sort
of roof, and approached by wooden steps. On the stage lies Apollo’s
luggage, consisting of a bag, a bow, and his Scythian cap. Chron is
represented as labouring under the effects of age and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span> blindness, and
supporting himself by the aid of a crooked staff, as he repairs to the
Delphian quack doctor for relief. The figure of the centaur is made to
ascend by the aid of a companion, both being furnished with the masks
and other attributes of the comic performers. Above are the mountains,
and on them the nymphs of Parnassus, who, like all the other actors
in the scene, are disguised with masks, and those of a very grotesque
character. On the right-hand side stands a figure which is considered
as representing the <i>epoptes</i>, the inspector or overseer of
the performance, who alone wears no mask. Even a pun is employed to
heighten the drollery of the scene, for instead of ΠΥΘΙΑΣ, the Pythian,
placed over the head of the burlesque Apollo, it seems evident that the
artist had written ΠΕΙΘΙΑΣ, the consoler in allusion, perhaps, to the
consolation which the quack-doctor is administering to his blind and
aged visitor.</p>

<p>The comic and grotesque led on to the representation of the monstrous,
and queer, strange figures became part of their art and architecture.
Out of these, perhaps, grew the hideous masks and strange distortions
of the human figure.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is why Æsop was represented as a dwarf and a hunchback.</p>

<p>But the whole trend of the grotesque and monstrous in religious
ornamentation grew and flourished on into the Middle Ages and later,
and the gargoyles of our latest churches show the persisting influence.</p>

<p>The old comedy of Greece has been called the comedy of caricature, and
hand in hand, verbal and pictorial parody have come to us down the
centuries.</p>

<p>Pictorial burlesque, however, was not placed on the public monuments,
but lent itself more readily to objects of common usage or individual
belongings. It is found abundantly on the pottery of Greece and Rome
and abounded in the wall paintings of Herculaneum and Pompeii.</p>

<p>This is not the place to discuss the identity of Homer. Whether a real
man, a group of men or a myth, the works of Homer are immortal and, for
the most part serious.</p>

<p>Our task is to find anything humorous in the Greek epics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span></p>

<p>It is not easy, indeed, it is almost impossible. But we subjoin an
extract which, we may say, comes the nearest to humor in Homer.</p>

        <div class="right">&mdash;<i>The Iliad.</i></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Attributed to Homer by many, and stoutly denied by others, is a comedy
called <i>The Battle of the Frogs and Mice</i>.</p>

<p>Again we note the device of animals masquerading as human beings.</p>

<p>Samuel Wesley, himself a humorist, calls this the oldest burlesque in
the world, and he also dubs it, <i>The Iliad in a Nutshell</i>. He
holds that Homer wrote it as a parody of his own masterpiece, while,
conversely, Statius contends that it is a work of youth, written by
Homer before he wrote <i>The Iliad</i>. Chapman deems it the work of
the poet’s old age, and as none may decide when doctors disagree, many
scholars deny a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span> Homeric authorship to it at all. Plutarch asserts the
real author was Pigres of Halicarnassus, who flourished during the
Persian war.</p>

<p>This first burlesque known to literature has the following plot.</p>

<p>A mouse, while slaking his thirst on the margin of a pond, after a
hot pursuit by a weasel, enters into conversation with a frog on the
merits of their respective modes of life. The frog invites the mouse
to a nearer inspection of the abode and habits of his own nation, and
for this purpose offers him a sail on his back. When the party are at
some distance from land, the head of an otter suddenly appears on the
surface. The terrified frog at once dives to the bottom, disengaging
himself from his rider, who, with many a struggle and bitter
imprecations on his betrayer, is involved in a watery grave. Another
mouse, who from the shore had witnessed the fate of his unfortunate
comrade, reports it to his fellow-citizens. A council is held, and war
declared against the nation of the offender.</p>

<p>“Jupiter and the gods deliberate in Olympus on the issue of the
contest. Mars and Minerva decline personal interference, as well from
the awe inspired by such mighty combatants as from previous ill-will
towards both contending powers, in consequence of injuries inflicted by
each on their divine persons or properties. A band of mosquitoes sound
the war-alarum with their trumpets, and, after a bloody engagement,
the frogs are defeated with great slaughter. Jupiter, sympathising
with their fate, endeavours in vain by his thunders to intimidate the
victors from further pursuit. The rescue of the frogs, however, is
effected by an army of land-crabs, who appear as their allies, and
before whom the mice, in their turn, are speedily put to flight.”</p>

<p><i>The Battle of the Frogs and Mice</i>, then, is well described as the
earliest and most successful extant specimen of the “mock-heroic,” the
double object of which is, according to Barrow’s famous definition, to
debase things pompous and elevate things mean. An amusing version of
this Homeric <i>jeu d’esprit</i> was published in 1851 by an author
who gave himself out as the “Singing Mouse,” “the last minstrel of his
race.” “The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span> theme,” he says, “belongs to that heroic age of which
history has recorded that the very mountains laboured when a mouse was
born.” The metre of this translation has been altered from the stately
elegance of the original to one which is perhaps better fitted to the
subject in itself than to its special object as a travestie on the
epic style of the <i>Iliad</i>. The names of the heroes are happily
rendered; but it will be seen that some difference exists between this
author and the one just cited as to certain of the zoological terms in
the poem.</p>

<p>By this time Greece was ready for definite mirth and laughter. What has
come to be known as the Old Comedy was to the Athenians, we are told,
what is now shown in the influences of the newspaper, the review, the
Broadside, the satire, the caricature of the times and manners.</p>

<p>Nor were cartoons missing, for the grotesque pictures were as important
a factor as the verbal or written words.</p>

<p>The Old Comedy is marked by political satire of a virulent personality.
This is prohibited in the Middle Comedy, and replaced by literary and
philosophical criticism of the ways of the citizens. The New Comedy,
more repressed still, is the comedy of manners, and its influence
continued to the Roman stage and further.</p>

<p>Of the Old Comedy, save for a few lesser lights, Aristophanes is the
sole representative.</p>

<p>At the festivals of the god Dionysus, two elements were present. One
the solemn rites, which developed into tragedy, and the other the
grotesque and ribald orgies which were equally in evidence and which
culminated in the idea of comedy.</p>

<p>The license of these symbolic representations was unbridled and all
rules of decorum and decency were violated in the frenzied antics.</p>

<p>Doubtless many writings now lost to us were filled with the broad humor
of the day, but we have only the plays of Aristophanes left.</p>

<p>Of the life of this Athenian not much is known. He was born after 450
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and it was after the Peloponnesian War that he wrote his
plays.</p>

<p>The principal and best known of his eleven extant plays is <i>The
Frogs</i>.</p>

<p>Of this, two clever translations are given.</p>

<p>One, is thus introduced by a writer in <i>The Quarterly Review</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“One of the temples or theatres appropriated to the service of Bacchus
in Athens, and in which the scenic performances of the old Greeks
took place, was situated near a part of that metropolis usually
called ‘The Marshes,’ and those who know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span> by experience what tenants
such places commonly harbour in more southern climates will think
it not impossible that the representatives of the stage, and more
particularly in theatres which were generally without a roof, were
occasionally disturbed, to the great annoyance of the dramatists, by
the noisy vociferations of these more ancient and legitimate Lords of
the Marshes. One of them was not a man to be offended with impunity
by biped or quadruped; and wherever the foes of Aristophanes were to
be found, on land or in water, he had shafts both able and willing to
reach them.</p>

<p>“In his descent to the lower world, the patron of the stage is
accordingly made to encounter a band of most pertinacious and
invincible frogs; and the gradations through which the mind of Bacchus
runs, after the first moments of irritation have subsided, from coaxing
to bullying, from affected indifference to downright force, are
probably a mere transcript of the poet’s own feelings under similar
circumstances.”</p>

<p>Another play of Aristophanes is <i>The Birds</i>.</p>

<p>The plot of this is simply that two Athenians, disgusted with the state
of things in their native city, form the idea of building a city where
the birds shall regain their old traditional supremacy.</p>

<p>The proposal is happily received by the birds and the city of
Nephelococyggia, or Cloud-cuckoo-town is the result.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span></p>

<p>It was merely a burlesque on the Athenians who were given to building
castles in the air.</p>

<p>Lack of space forbids further quotation from Aristophanes, but his
comedies are available to all who wish to read them.</p>

<p>Among the predecessors of Aristophanes was Cratinus, who was an enemy
of water drinkers, and expressed the dictum that no verses written by
abstainers could ever please or live!</p>

<p>Another, whose fragmentary lines have a certain modern ring, is
Simonides, who left us a poem of the ladies, which, it has been said,
gave the tone to all the Greek pasquinades of the same class. He
compares the different types of ladies to various members of the lower
orders in creation; and the “Fine Lady” is represented by a high-bred
steed.</p>

    <h4><i>THE FINE LADY. BY SIMONIDES.</i></h4>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Next in the lot a gallant dame we see,</div>
        <div>Sprung from a mare of noble pedigree;</div>
        <div>No servile work her spirit proud can brook,</div>
        <div>Her hands were never taught to bake or cook;</div>
        <div>The vapour of the oven makes her ill,</div>
        <div>She scorns to empty slops or turn the mill.</div>
        <div>To wash or scour would make her soft hands rough,</div>
        <div>Her own ablutions give pursuit enough;</div>
        <div>Three baths a day, with balms and perfumes rare,</div>
        <div>Refresh her tender limbs. Her long rich hair</div>
        <div>Each time she combs and decks with blooming flowers.</div>
        <div>No spouse more fit than she the idle hours</div>

  </div>

<p>Plato Comicus (as distinguished from the philosopher), who carried on a
poetic contest with Aristophanes, ranks among the best of the poets of
the Old Comedy, but only a few fragments of his work remain.</p>

<p>Here are two of them:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="ileft">“Henceforth no four-legged creature should be slain,</div>
        <div>Except the pig; of this the reason’s plain.</div>
        <div>Its use&mdash;unless for food&mdash;man vainly seeks;</div>
        <div>It only gives him bristles, dirt, and squeaks.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="ileft">“We’re swamped with ‘public men’; for one scamp dead,</div>
        <div>Two louder talkers, greater scamps, instead</div>
        <div>Spring up like Hydra’s heads: the more’s the pity</div>
        <div>We have no Iolaus in the city</div>
        <div>To singe the necks from which these pests arise,</div>
        <div>In whom foul lives alone secure the prize.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>As students of the Classics themselves find great difficulty in drawing
strict boundaries between the Old and Middle Comedy, we need not pay
careful attention to exact dates, but accept the general idea that one
passed into the other at about the time the Peloponnesian War ended.</p>

<p>This was 404 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and Middle Comedy may be said to extend from
that date until the overthrow of the Athenians by Philip of Macedon in
338 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The most distinguished poet of the Middle Comedy was Antiphanes, who
lived in the Fourth Century, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>His lines are epigrammatic and frequently refer to the prevailing theme
of drunkenness.</p>

<p>Aristotle, though the first to put into words the definition of the
ridiculous, can furnish no extracts which come within our present scope.</p>

<p>Indeed the great teacher considered comedy from its dramatic side
rather than as mere humor.</p>

<p>One of his pupils, Theophrastus, left us some fragments, especially a
short collection of character sketches which show both wit and humor.</p>

<h4><i>OF SLOVENLINESS</i></h4>

<p>This vice is a lazy and beastly negligence of a man’s person, whereby
he becomes so filthy as to be offensive to those who are about him.
You’ll see him come into a company when he is covered all over with a
leprosy or scurf, or with very long nails, and he says those distempers
are hereditary, that his father and grandfather had them before him.
He will speak with his mouth full, and gurgle at his cup in drinking.
He will intrude into the best company in ragged clothes. If he goes
with his mother to the soothsayers, he cannot even then refrain from
coarse and profane expressions. When he is making his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span> oblations at
the temple, he will let the dish fall out of his hand, and laugh as at
some jocular exploit. At the finest concert of music he cannot forbear
clapping his hands and making a rude noise. He will pretend to sing
along with the singers, and rail at them when they leave off.</p>

<p class="r2 p-min">&mdash;<i>The Characters.</i></p>


<h4><i>OF LOQUACITY</i></h4>

<p>If we would define loquacity, it is an excessive affluence of words.
The prater will not suffer any person in company to tell his own story,
but, let it be what it will, tells you you mistake the matter, that
he takes the thing right, and that if you will listen, he will make
it clear to you. If you make any reply, he suddenly interrupts you,
saying, “Why, sir, you forget what you were talking about; it’s very
well you should begin to remember, since it is most beneficial for
people to inform one another.” Then presently he says, “But what was I
going to say? Why, truly, you very soon apprehend a thing, and I was
waiting to see if you would be of my sentiment in this matter.” And
thus he always takes such occasions as these to prevent the person
he talks with the liberty of breathing. After he has thus tormented
all who will hear him, he is so rude as to break into the company of
persons met to discuss important affairs, and drives them away by his
troublesome impertinence. Thence he goes into the public schools and
places of exercise, where he interrupts the masters by his foolish
prating, and hinders the scholars from improving by their instruction.
If any person shows an inclination to go away, he will follow him, and
will not part from him till he comes to his own door. If he hears of
anything transacted in the public assembly of the citizens, he runs
up and down to tell it to everybody. He gives you a long account of
the famous battle that was fought when Aristophanes the orator was
governor, or when the Lacedæmonians were under the command of Lysander;
then tells you with what general applause he made a speech in public,
repeating a great deal of it, with invectives against the common
people, which are so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span> tiresome to those that hear him that some forget
what he says as soon as it is out of his mouth, others fall asleep,
and others leave him in the midst of his harangue. If this talker be
sitting on the bench, the judge will be unable to determine matters.
If he’s at the theater, he’ll neither let you hear nor see anything;
nor will he even permit him that sits next to him at the table to eat
his meat. He declares it very hard for him to be silent, his tongue
being so very well hung that he’d rather be accounted as garrulous as
a swallow than be silent, and patiently bears all ridicule, even that
of his own children, who, when they want to go to rest, request him to
talk to them that they may the sooner fall asleep.</p>

<p class="r2 p-min">&mdash;<i>The Characters.</i></p>

<p>One of the Characters described by Theophrastus is <i>The Stupid
Man</i>, and runs thus:</p>

<p>“The stupid man is one who, after doing a sum and setting down the
total, will ask the person next him, ‘What does it come to?’”</p>

<p>It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that this is the beginning
or at least the popularizing of the class of jests known as Noodles or
Noodle Stories.</p>

<p>For all nations and races have folk-lore that details the sayings and
doings of the witless or silly.</p>

<p>The Literature of the Orient abounds in these tales and European
stories of the same sort are equally abundant.</p>

<p>The collection of jokes ascribed to Hierocles, may or may not have
been gathered by that Alexandrian philosopher. The only form in which
we may read them is said to have been made not earlier than the Ninth
Century, but the stories themselves are among the very earliest of the
traditional jests of all time.</p>

<p>Some of these old jokemongers’ witticisms are capital&mdash;so good, in
fact, that the parentage of many of them has been claimed by modern
wits. No doubt we shall recognise some old friends as we read:</p>

<p>I. A pedant (for so we must probably translate, in conventional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
phrase, the pervading Scholastichus of the old jokemonger) wishing to
teach his horse not to eat much, gave him no food. Eventually the horse
died of starvation; and he complained to his friends, “I have suffered
a great loss, for just when I had taught my horse to live upon nothing
he died.”</p>

<p>II. A pedant having bought a cask of wine, sealed it. But his slave
bored a hole and stole the wine. The master was amazed to find that,
though his seals were unbroken, the wine gradually diminished. Someone
suggested that he should examine whether it had been taken out from the
bottom. “Fool,” he replied, “it isn’t the lower part that’s gone. It’s
the upper.”</p>

<p>III. A pedant suffered shipwreck in a tempest, and seeing the
passengers tie themselves to different articles on board, fastened
himself to one of the anchors.</p>

<p>IV. Another had to cross a river, and went on board the ferry-boat on
horseback. Somebody asked him why he did so, and he replied because he
was in a hurry.</p>

<p>V. Yet another, anxious to know whether he looked well when he was
asleep, stood before a looking-glass with his eyes shut to see.</p>

<p>VI. A landlord, who had a house to sell, went about amongst his
friends, carrying a brick as a specimen.</p>

<p>In connection with these stories may be cited the following, from a
Persian jest-book: A poor wrestler, who had passed all his life in
forests, resolved to try his fortune in a great city, and as he drew
near it he observed with wonder the crowds on the road, and thought,
“I shall certainly not be able to know myself among so many people if
I have not something about me that the others have not.” So he tied a
pumpkin to his right leg and, thus decorated, entered the town. A young
wag, perceiving the simpleton, made friends with him, and induced him
to spend the night at his house. While he was asleep, the joker removed
the pumpkin from his leg and tied it to his own, and then lay down
again. In the morning, when the poor fellow awoke and found the pumpkin
on his companion’s leg, he called to him, “Hey! get up, for I am
perplexed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span> in my mind. Who am I, and who are you? If I am myself, why
is the pumpkin on your leg? And if you are yourself, why is the pumpkin
not on my leg?”</p>

<p>Modern counterparts of the following jest are not far to seek: Quoth
a man to a pedant, “The slave I bought of you has died.” Rejoined the
other, “By the gods, I do assure you that he never once played me such
a trick while I had him.” The old Greek pedant is transformed into an
Irishman, in our collections of facetiæ, who applied to a farmer for
work. “I’ll have nothing to do with you,” said the farmer, “for the
last five Irishmen I had all died on my hands.” Quoth Pat, “Sure, sir,
I can bring you characters from half a dozen gentlemen I’ve worked for
that I never did such a thing.” And the jest is thus told in an old
translation of <i>Les Contes Facetieux de Sieur Gaulard</i>: “Speaking
of one of his Horses which broake his Neck at the descent of a Rock, he
said, Truly it was one of the handsomest and best Curtalls in all the
Country; he neuer shewed me such a trick before in all his life.”</p>

<p>Equally familiar is the jest of the pedant who was looking out for a
place to prepare a tomb for himself, and on a friend indicating what he
thought to be a suitable spot, “Very true,” said the pedant, “but it is
unhealthy.” And we have the prototype of a modern “Irish” story in the
following: A pedant sealed a jar of wine, and his slaves perforated it
below and drew off some of the liquor. He was astonished to find his
wine disappear while the seal remained intact. A friend, to whom he
had communicated the affair, advised him to look and ascertain if the
liquor had not been drawn off from below. “Why, you fool,” said he, “it
is not the lower, but the upper, portion that is going off.”</p>

<p>It was a Greek pedant who stood before a mirror and shut his eyes
that he might know how he looked when asleep&mdash;a jest which reappears
in Taylor’s <i>Wit and Mirth</i> in this form: “A wealthy monsieur in
France (hauing profound reuenues and a shallow braine) was told by his
man that he did continually gape in his sleepe, at which he was angry
with his man, saying he would not belieue it. His man verified it to
be true; his master said that he would neuer belieue any that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span> told
him so, except (quoth hee) I chance to see it with mine owne eyes; and
therefore I will have a great Looking glasse at my bed’s feet for the
purpose to try whether thou art a lying knaue or not.”</p>

<p>Not unlike some of our “Joe Millers” is the following: A citizen
of Cumæ, on an ass, passed by an orchard, and seeing a branch of a
fig-tree loaded with delicious fruit, he laid hold of it, but the
ass went on, leaving him suspended. Just then the gardener came up,
and asked him what he did there. The man replied, “I fell off the
ass.”&mdash;An analogue to this drollery is found in an Indian story-book,
entitled <i>Kathȧ Manjari</i>: One day a thief climbed up a cocoanut
tree in a garden to steal the fruit. The gardener heard the noise,
and while he was running from his house, giving the alarm, the thief
hastily descended from the tree. “Why were you up that tree?” asked the
gardener. The thief replied, “My brother, I went up to gather grass for
my calf.” “Ha! ha! is there grass, then, on a cocoanut tree?” said the
gardener. “No,” quoth the thief; “but I did not know; therefore I came
down again.”&mdash;And we have a variant of this in the Turkish jest of the
fellow who went into a garden and pulled up carrots, turnips, and other
kinds of vegetables, some of which he put into a sack, and some into
his bosom. The gardener, coming suddenly on the spot, laid hold of him,
and said, “What are you seeking here?” The simpleton replied, “For some
days past a great wind has been blowing, and that wind blew me hither.”
“But who pulled up these vegetables?” “As the wind blew very violently,
it cast me here and there; and whatever I laid hold of in the hope of
saving myself remained in my hands.” “Ah,” said the gardener, “but who
filled this sack with them?” “Well, that is the very question I was
about to ask myself when you came up.”</p>

<p>The Greek Anthology brings together short poems and epigrams written
during the thousand years between Simonides’ time and the sixth century
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span></p>

<p>Collected shortly before the beginning of the Christian Era and added
to later, they comprise about four thousand five hundred specimens, by
three hundred authors. Few of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span> are witty, as, indeed, few are
epigrammatic, but of them we quote some which seem most appurtenant.</p>

<p>“<i>Zeus.</i> Do, Æsculapius and Heracles, stop your wrangling, in
which you indulge as if you were a couple of mortals; for this sort of
behavior is unseemly, and quite strange to the banquets of the gods.</p>

<p>“<i>Heracles.</i> But, Zeus, would you have that quack drug-dealer
there take his place at table above me?</p>

<p>“<i>Æsculapius.</i> By Zeus, yes, for I am certainly the better man.</p>

<p>“<i>Heracles.</i> How, you thunderstruck fellow, is it, pray, because
Zeus knocked you on the head with his bolt for your unlawful actions,
and because now, out of mere pity, by way of compensation, you have got
a share of immortality?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span></p>

<p>“<i>Æsculapius.</i> What! have you, for your part, Heracles, altogether
forgotten your having been burned to ashes on Mount Œta, that you throw
in my teeth this fire you talk of?</p>

<p>“<i>Heracles.</i> We have not lived at all an equal or similar sort of
life&mdash;I, who am the son of Zeus, and have undergone so many and great
labors, purifying human life, contending against and conquering wild
beasts, and punishing insolent and injurious men; whereas you are a
paltry herb-doctor and mountebank, skilful, possibly, in palming off
your miserable drugs upon sick fools, but who have never given proof of
any noble, manly disposition.</p>

<p>“<i>Æsculapius.</i> You say well, seeing I healed your burns when you
came up but now half-burned, with your body all marred and destroyed by
the double cause of your death&mdash;the poisoned shirt, and afterward the
fire. Now I, if I have done nothing else, at least have neither worked
like a slave, as you have, nor have I carded wool in Lydia, dressed in
a fine purple gown; nor have I been beaten by that Omphale of yours,
with her golden slipper. No, nor did I, in a mad fit, kill my children
and my wife!</p>

<p>“<i>Heracles.</i> If you don’t stop your ribald abuse of me at once,
you shall very speedily learn your immortality will not avail you much;
for I will take and pitch you head first out of heaven, so that not
even the wonderful Pæon himself shall cure you and your broken skull.</p>

<p>“<i>Zeus.</i> Have done, I say, and don’t disturb the harmony of the
company, or I will pack both of you off from the supper-room; although,
to speak the truth, Heracles, it is fair and reasonable Æsculapius
should have precedence of you at table, inasmuch as he even took
precedence of you in death.”</p>

<h4><i>ODYSSEUS’S TRICK ON POLYPHEMUS</i><br />
<span class="subhed"><span class="smcap">Poseidon</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Polyphemus</span></span></h4>

<p class="p1">“<i>Polyphemus.</i> Oh, father, what have I endured at the hands of the
cursed stranger, who made me drunk and put out my eye, assaulting me
when I was lulled to sleep!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span></p>

<p>“<i>Poseidon.</i> Who dared to do this, my poor Polyphemus?</p>

<p>“<i>Polyphemus.</i> In the first instance, he called himself Outis; but
when he had got clear away, and was out of reach of my arrow, he said
that his name was Odysseus.</p>

<p>“<i>Poseidon.</i> I know whom you speak of&mdash;him of Ithaca, and he was
on his return voyage from Ilium. But how did he do it, for he is by no
means a man of too much courage?</p>

<p>“<i>Polyphemus.</i> Returning from my accustomed attending of my flock,
I caught a number of fellows in my cave, evidently having designs on
my herds; for when I placed the stone block against the door&mdash;the rock
is of huge size&mdash;and had lighted the fire by igniting the tree which
I brought from the mountain, evidently they appeared to be trying
to conceal themselves. Well, when I had got hold of some of them I
devoured them for a pack of thieves, as was reasonable. Hereupon that
most villainous rascal, whether he was Outis or Odysseus, pours out a
sort of drug and gives me to drink&mdash;sweet, indeed, and of delicious
smell, but most insidious, and which caused great disorder in my head;
for, immediately upon my drinking, everything seemed to me to be in a
whirl, and the cave itself was turned upside down, and I was no longer
at all in my senses; and at last I was dragged down into sleep. Then
sharpening the bar, and igniting it besides, he blinded me as I slept,
and from that time I am a blind man, at your service, Poseidon.</p>

<p>“<i>Poseidon.</i> How soundly you slept, my son, that you did not
jump up while you were being blinded! But as for this Odysseus, then,
how did he escape? For he could not&mdash;I am well assured that he could
not&mdash;move away the rock from the door.</p>

<p>“<i>Polyphemus.</i> Yes, but it was I who removed it, that I might the
better catch him as he was going out; and, sitting down close to the
door, I groped for him with extended hands, letting only my sheep go
out to pasture, after having given instructions to the ram what he was
to do in my place.</p>

<p>“<i>Poseidon.</i> I perceive: they slipped away unnoticed, under the
sheep. But you ought to have shouted, and called the rest of the
Cyclopes to your aid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span></p>

<p>“<i>Polyphemus.</i> I did summon them, father, and they came. But
when they asked the sneaking rascal’s name, and I said it was Outis,
thinking I was in a mad fit, they took themselves off at once. Thus the
cursed fellow tricked me with his name; and what especially vexes me
is, that he actually threw my misfortune in my teeth. ‘Not even,’ said
he, ‘will your father Poseidon cure you.’</p>

<p>“<i>Poseidon.</i> Never mind, my child, for I will revenge myself upon
him; he shall learn that, even if it is not possible for me to heal the
mutilation of people’s eyes, at all events the fate of voyagers is in
my hands. And he is still at sea.”</p>

<h3>PART II<br />
<span class="subhed">ROME</span></h3></div>

<p>The Roman Juvenal observed, “All Greece is a comedian.” But he could
not say the same of his own country.</p>

<p>Though there was Roman Comedy and Roman Satire, the real and
spontaneous spirit of fun was conspicuously lacking in the tastes and
tendencies of the Romans.</p>

<p>Glory is attributed to Greece and grandeur to Rome, and it may be the
“sudden glory” of humor was an integral part of the Grecian nature.</p>

<p>Yet we must not differentiate too carefully between the two, for the
literature of Greece and Rome is so fused and intermingled that only a
historian may take up the chronological tabulation.</p>

<p>For our purpose it is well to let the literature of the two countries
merge and continue the consideration of classic comedy without over
cautious regard for dates.</p>

<p>The Greek influence on literature of all ages will never disappear, but
the Greek spirit of pure joy and gaiety will, probably never reappear.</p>

<p>From the beginnings of Greece, on through the existence of Rome,
and down through the Mediæval Ages, the world of letters was
self-contained, a single proposition. From 500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> to 1300
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> the traditions of primal Greece and Rome continued to be
the common possession of all Europe.</p>

<p>After that, literature became diverse and divergent among the
countries. It was independent as well as interdependent, but this
condition makes an inevitable division of time.</p>

<p>Greece, Rome, Mediæval Times,&mdash;these are the three sections of the
Middle portion of this book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span></p>

<p>Rome, then, considered by herself, brought forth little quotable
humorous literature, and what we have to choose from is ponderous and
heavy.</p>

<p>Like Greece, the first germs of Roman comic literature may be traced to
the religious festivals, which were marked by an admixture of religious
rites and riotous Bacchanalian orgies, where as the crowds danced and
sang and feasted, they became first hilarious and then abusive and
indecent.</p>

<p>Like the Greeks, the Romans used grotesque masks, large enough to
represent face and hair, too, the duplicates of which we see decorating
our theater proscenium arches and drop curtains to this day.</p>

<p>It would seem these masks were universally made use of in their
dramatic performances, for all caricatures and grotesque drawings show
them.</p>

<p>In the burlesque entertainments there was a Buffoon, corresponding to
our clown, called a Sannio, from the Greek word meaning a fool.</p>

<p>Later, undoubtedly, the Court Fool and the King’s Jester were the
natural successors of this character.</p>

<p>In all these masks the features were exaggerated and made monstrous of
form and size. But one reason for the greatly enlarged mouth is that
it was so shaped in order to form a sort of speaking trumpet, that the
actors’ voices might be heard at greater distance.</p>

<p>In contrast to the grotesquerie of enlargement, there was also a branch
of caricature which depicted the pigmies.</p>

<p>The legend of the pigmies and cranes is as ancient, at least, as Homer,
and many examples are found in the buried cities of Herculaneum and
Pompeii.</p>

<p>Comic Literature was not plentiful in the days of Early Rome. Up to the
second century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> we can glean but the two names, Plautus
and Terence.</p>

<p>These two, nearly contemporary, founded their plays on the comedies of
Menander and a few other earlier dramatic writers.</p>

<p>Perhaps twenty plays are left us from the hands of these two Romans,
and these, though pronounced amusing by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span> scholars who can read the
original text, are not what the modern layman deems very humorous.</p>

<p>A few examples of them will suffice.</p>

<p class="center sm"><span class="allsmcap">PYRGOPOLINICES</span>, <span class="allsmcap">ARTOTROGUS</span>, <i>and</i>
<span class="allsmcap">SOLDIERS</span></p>

<p class="p1"><i>Pyrgopolinices.</i> Take care that the luster of my shield is more
bright than the rays of the sun when the sky is clear, that, when
occasion comes, the battle being joined, ’mid the fierce ranks right
opposite it may dazzle the eyesight of the enemy. But I must console
this saber of mine, that it may not lament nor be downcast in spirits,
because I have thus long been wearing it keeping holiday, though it so
dreadfully longs to make havoc of the enemy. But where is Artotrogus?</p>

<p><i>Artotrogus.</i> Here he is; he stands close by the hero, valiant and
successful, and of princely form. Mars could not dare to style himself
so great a warrior, nor compare his prowess with yours.</p>

<p><i>Pyrgopolinices.</i> Him you mean whom I spared on the Gorgonidonian
plains, where Bumbomachides Clytomestoridysarchides, the grandson of
Neptune, was the chief commander?</p>

<p><i>Artotrogus.</i> I remember him; him, I suppose you mean, with the
golden armor, whose legions you puffed away with your breath, just as
the wind blows away leaves or the reed-thatched roof.</p>

<p><i>Pyrgopolinices.</i> That, by my troth, was really nothing at all.</p>

<p><i>Artotrogus.</i> Faith, that really was nothing at all in comparison
with other things I could mention (<i>aside</i>) which you never did.
If any person ever beheld a more perjured fellow than this, or one more
full in vain boasting, let him have me for himself: I’ll become his
slave.</p>

<p><i>Pyrgopolinices.</i> What are you saying?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span></p>

<p><i>Artotrogus.</i> Why, that I remember in what fashion you broke the
foreleg of an elephant, in India, with your fist.</p>

<p><i>Pyrgopolinices.</i> How&mdash;the foreleg?</p>

<p><i>Artotrogus.</i> I meant to say the thigh.</p>

<p><i>Pyrgopolinices.</i> I struck the blow without an effort.</p>

<p><i>Artotrogus.</i> Troth, if, indeed, you had put forth your strength,
your arm would have passed right through the hide, the entrails, and
the frontispiece of the elephant.</p>

<p><i>Pyrgopolinices.</i> I don’t care to talk about these things just now.</p>

<p><i>Artotrogus.</i> I’ faith, ’tis really not worth while for you to
tell me of it, who know your prowess well. (<i>Aside.</i>) My appetite
creates all these tales. I must hear him right out with my ears, that
my teeth mayn’t have time to grow, and whatever lie he shall tell I
must agree to it.</p>

<p><i>Pyrgopolinices.</i> What was it I was saying?</p>

<p><i>Artotrogus.</i> Oh, I know what you were going to say just now. I’
faith ’twas bravely done; I remember its being done.</p>

<p><i>Pyrgopolinices.</i> What was that?</p>

<p><i>Artotrogus.</i> Whatever it was you were going to say.</p>

<p><i>Pyrgopolinices.</i> Have you got your tablets?</p>

<p><i>Artotrogus.</i> Are you intending to enlist some one? I have them,
and a pen as well.</p>

<p><i>Pyrgopolinices.</i> How quickly you guess my thoughts!</p>

<p><i>Artotrogus.</i> ’Tis fit that I should study your inclinations, so
that whatever you wish should first occur to me.</p>

<p><i>Pyrgopolinices.</i> What do you remember?</p>

<p><i>Artotrogus.</i> I do remember this: In Cilicia there were a hundred
and fifty men, a hundred in Cryphiolathronia, thirty at Sardis, sixty
men of Macedon, whom you slaughtered altogether in one day.</p>

<p><i>Pyrgopolinices.</i> What is the sum total of those men?</p>

<p><i>Artotrogus.</i> Seven thousand.</p>

<p><i>Pyrgopolinices.</i> It must be as much; you keep the reckoning well.</p>

<p><i>Artotrogus.</i> Yet I have none of them written down; still, I
remember it was so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span></p>

<p><i>Pyrgopolinices.</i> By my troth, you have a right good memory.</p>

<p><i>Artotrogus</i> (<i>aside</i>). ’Tis the flesh-pots give it a fillip.</p>

<p><i>Pyrgopolinices.</i> So long as you shall do as you have done
hitherto, you shall always have something to eat; I will always make
you a partaker at my table.</p>

<p><i>Artotrogus.</i> Besides, in Cappadocia you would have killed five
hundred men altogether at one blow, had not your saber been blunt.</p>

<p><i>Pyrgopolinices.</i> I let them live, because I was quite sick of
fighting.</p>

<p><i>Artotrogus.</i> Why should I tell you what all mortals know, that
you, Pyrgopolinices, live upon the earth with your valor, beauty, and
achievements unsurpassed? All the women are in love with you, and that
not without reason, since you are so handsome. Witness those girls that
pulled me by my mantle yesterday.</p>

<p><i>Pyrgopolinices.</i> What was it they said to you?</p>

<p><i>Artotrogus.</i> They questioned me about you. “Is Achilles here?”
says one to me. “No,” says I, “his brother is.” Then says the other to
me, “By my troth, but he is a handsome and a noble man. See how his
long hair becomes him! Certainly the women are lucky who share his
favors.”</p>

<p><i>Pyrgopolinices.</i> And pray, did they really say so?</p>

<p><i>Artotrogus.</i> They both entreated me to bring you past today, so
that they might see you.</p>

<p><i>Pyrgopolinices.</i> ’Tis really a very great plague to a man to be
too handsome!</p>

<p><i>Artotrogus.</i> They are quite a nuisance to me; they are praying,
entreating, beseeching me to let them see you; sending for me for that
purpose, so that I can’t give my attention to your business.</p>

<p><i>Pyrgopolinices.</i> It seems that it is time for us to go to the
Forum, that I may count out their pay to those soldiers whom I lately
enlisted; for King Seleucus entreated me with most earnest suit that
I would raise and enlist recruits for him. To that business I have
resolved to devote my attention this day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span></p>

<p><i>Artotrogus.</i> Come, let’s be going, then.</p>

<p><i>Pyrgopolinices.</i> Guards, follow me.</p>

<h4><i>THE SUSPICIOUS MISER</i><br />
<span class="subhed"><span class="allsmcap">MEGADORUS</span> <i>and</i> <span class="allsmcap">EUNOMIA</span></span></h4>

<p class="p1"><i>Eunomia.</i> Tell me pray, who is she whom you would like to take
for a wife?</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> I’ll tell you. Do you know that Euclio, the poor old
man close by?</p>

<p><i>Eunomia.</i> I know him; not a bad sort of man.</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> I’d like his maiden daughter to be promised me in
marriage. Don’t make any words about it, sister; I know what you are
going to say&mdash;that she’s poor. This poor girl pleases me.</p>

<p><i>Eunomia.</i> May the gods prosper it!</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> I hope the same.</p>

<p><i>Eunomia.</i> Do you wish me to stay for anything else?</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> No; farewell.</p>

<p><i>Eunomia.</i> And to you the same, brother.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Goes into the house.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> I’ll go to see Euclio, if he’s at home. But, ah! here
comes the very man toward his own house!</p>

<p class="center p1 sm"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Euclio</span></p>

<p class="p1"><i>Euclio</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I had a presentiment that I was
going out to no purpose when I left my house, and therefore I went
unwillingly; for neither did any one of the wardsmen come, nor yet
the master of the ward, who ought to have distributed the money. Now
I’m making all haste to hasten home; for, though I myself am here, my
mind’s at home.</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> May you be well, and ever fortunate, Euclio!</p>

<p><i>Euclio.</i> May the gods bless you, Megadorus!</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> How are you? Are you quite well and contented?</p>

<p><i>Euclio</i> (<i>aside</i>). It isn’t for nothing when a rich man
accosts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span> a poor man courteously. Now, this fellow knows that I’ve got
some gold; for that reason he salutes me more courteously.</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> Do you say that you are well?</p>

<p><i>Euclio.</i> Oh, I’m not very well in the money line.</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> But if you’ve a contented mind, you have enough for
passing a happy life with.</p>

<p><i>Euclio</i> (<i>aside</i>). By my faith, the old woman has made a
discovery to him about the gold; it is clear she has told him. I’ll cut
off her tongue, and tear out her eyes, when I get home.</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> Why are you talking to yourself?</p>

<p><i>Euclio.</i> I’m lamenting my poverty. I’ve a grown-up girl without a
portion, and one that can’t be disposed of in marriage; nor am I able
to marry her to anybody.</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> Hold your peace; be of good courage, Euclio; she
shall have a husband; you shall be assisted by myself. If you have need
of help, command me.</p>

<p><i>Euclio</i> (<i>aside</i>). Now he is aiming at my property, while
he’s making promises. He’s gaping for my gold, that he may devour it;
in the one hand he is carrying a stone, while he shows the bread in the
other. I trust no person who, rich himself, is exceedingly courteous
to a poor man; when he extends his hand with a kind air, then is he
loading you with some damage. I know these polyps, who, when they’ve
touched a thing, hold it fast.</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> Give me your attention, Euclio, for a little while;
I wish to speak a few words to you about a common concern of yours and
mine.</p>

<p><i>Euclio</i> (<i>aside</i>). Alas! wo is me! My gold has been carried
off from my house. Now he’s wishing for this thing, I’m sure, to come
to a compromise with me; but I’ll look in my house first.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>He goes toward his door.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> Where are you going?</p>

<p><i>Euclio.</i> I’ll return to you directly, for there’s something I
must go and see to at home.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Goes into his house.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> I verily believe that when I make mention of his
daughter, for him to promise her to me, he’ll suppose that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span> I am
laughing at him; for I do not know of any man poorer than he.</p>

<p class="center p1 sm"><span class="smcap">Euclio</span> <i>returns from his house</i></p>

<p class="p1"><i>Euclio</i> (<i>aside</i>). The gods favor me; my property’s all
safe. If nothing’s lost, it’s safe. I was dreadfully afraid before I
went indoors. I was almost dead. (<i>Aloud.</i>) I’m come back to you,
Megadorus, if you wish to say anything to me.</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> I thank you. I beg that as to what I shall inquire of
you, you’ll not hesitate to speak out boldly.</p>

<p><i>Euclio.</i> So long, indeed, as you inquire nothing that I mayn’t
choose to speak out upon.</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> Tell me, of what sort of family do you consider me to
be sprung?</p>

<p><i>Euclio.</i> Of a good one.</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> What do you think about my character?</p>

<p><i>Euclio.</i> It’s a good one.</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> What of my conduct?</p>

<p><i>Euclio.</i> Neither bad nor dishonest.</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> Do you know my age?</p>

<p><i>Euclio.</i> I know that you are as rich in years as in pocket.</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> I surely did always take you to be a citizen without
evil guile, and now I am convinced.</p>

<p>Euclio (<i>aside</i>). He smells the gold. (<i>Aloud.</i>) What do you
want with me now?</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> Since you know me, and I know you, what sort of
person you are, may it bring a blessing on myself, and you and your
daughter, if I now ask your daughter as my wife. Promise me that it
shall be so.</p>

<p><i>Euclio.</i> Heyday! Megadorus, you are doing a deed that’s not
becoming to your usual actions, in laughing at me, a poor man, and
guiltless toward yourself and toward your family. For neither in act,
nor in words, have I ever deserved it of you that you should do what
you are doing now.</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> I vow that I neither came to laugh at you nor am I
laughing at you, nor do I think you deserving of it.</p>

<p><i>Euclio.</i> Why, then, do you ask my daughter for yourself?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span></p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> Because I believe that the match would be a good
thing for all of us.</p>

<p><i>Euclio.</i> It suggests itself to my mind, Megadorus, that you are a
wealthy man, a man of rank, and that I am the poorest of the poor. Now,
if I should give my daughter in marriage to you, it suggests itself to
my mind that you are the ox, and that I am the ass; when I’m yoked to
you, and when I’m not able to bear the burden equally with yourself,
I, the ass, must lie down in the mire; you, the ox, would regard me no
more than if I had never been born. I should then feel aggrieved, and
my own class would laugh at me. In neither direction should I have a
fixed stall, if there should be a divorce; the asses would tear me with
their teeth, the oxen would butt at me with their horns. This is the
great risk, in my passing over from the asses to the oxen.</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> The nearer you can unite yourself in alliance with
honorable people the better. Do you receive this proposal, listen to
me, and promise her to me.</p>

<p><i>Euclio.</i> But there is no marriage portion, I tell you.</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> You are to give none; so long as she comes with good
principles, she is sufficiently portioned.</p>

<p><i>Euclio.</i> I say so for this reason, that you mayn’t be supposing
that I have found any treasures.</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> I know that; don’t enlarge upon it. Promise her to me.</p>

<p><i>Euclio.</i> So be it. (<i>Starts and looks about.</i>) But, oh,
Jupiter, am I not utterly undone?</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> What’s the matter with you?</p>

<p><i>Euclio.</i> What was it sounded just now as though it were iron?</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> I ordered them to dig up the garden at my place.
(<span class="smcap">Euclio</span> <i>runs off into his house.</i>) But where has this
man gone? He’s off, and he hasn’t fully answered me; he treats me with
contempt. Because he sees that I wish for his friendship, he acts
after the usual manner of mankind. For if a wealthy person goes to ask
a favor of a poorer one, the poor man is afraid to treat with him;
through suspicion he hurts his own interest. The same person, when this
opportunity is lost, afterward wishes for it too late.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span></p>

<p><i>Euclio</i> (<i>coming out of the house, addressing servant
within</i>). By the powers, if I don’t give you up to have your tongue
cut out by the roots, I order and I authorize you to hand me over to
any one you please, to be mutilated.</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> By my troth, Euclio, I perceive that you consider me
a fit man for you to make sport of in my old age, for no fault of my
own.</p>

<p><i>Euclio.</i> I’ faith, Megadorus, I am not doing so, nor should I
desire it were I able to.</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> Well, then, do you betroth your daughter to me?</p>

<p><i>Euclio.</i> On those terms, and with that portion which I mentioned
to you.</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> Do you promise her, then?</p>

<p><i>Euclio.</i> I do promise her.</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> May the gods bestow their blessings on it!</p>

<p><i>Euclio.</i> May the gods do so! Observe and remember that we’ve
agreed, that my daughter is not to bring you any portion.</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> I remember it.</p>

<p><i>Euclio.</i> But I understand in what fashion people are wont
to equivocate; an agreement is no agreement, no agreement is an
agreement&mdash;just as it pleases you.</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> I’ll have no misunderstanding with you. But what
reason is there why we shouldn’t have the nuptials this day?</p>

<p><i>Euclio.</i> Why, by my troth, there is very good reason why we
should.</p>

<p><i>Megadorus.</i> I’ll go, then, and prepare matters. Do you want me
for anything more?</p>

<p><i>Euclio.</i> All is settled. Farewell.</p>

<p><i>Megadorus</i> (<i>going to the door of his house and calling
out</i>). Hullo! Strobilus, follow me quickly to the meat-market.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Megadorus</span>.)</p>

<p><i>Euclio.</i> He has gone. Immortal gods, I do beseech you! How
powerful is gold! I do believe, now, that he has had some intimation
that I’ve got a treasure at home. He’s gaping for that; for the sake of
that has he persisted in this alliance!</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Terence</span><br />
<span class="subhed sm"><i>PARASITES AND GNATHONITES</i></span></h4>

<p class="p1"><i>Gnathonites</i> (<i>soliloquizing</i>). Immortal gods! how far
does one man excel another! What a difference there is between a wise
person and a fool! This came strongly into my mind from the following
circumstance. As I was walking along to-day I met a certain individual
of this place, of my own rank and station&mdash;no mean fellow&mdash;one who,
like myself, had guttled away his paternal estate. I saw him, shabby,
dirty, sickly, beset with rags and years. “What’s the meaning of
this garb?” said I. He answered, “Wretch that I am, I’ve lost what I
possessed; see to what I am reduced; all my acquaintances and friends
have forsaken me.” On this I felt contempt for him as in comparison
with myself. “What!” said I, “you pitiful sluggard, have you so managed
matters as to have no hope left? Have you lost your wits together with
your estate? Don’t you see me, who have risen from the same condition?
What a complexion I have, how spruce and well dressed, what portliness
of person? I have everything, yet have nothing; and although I possess
nothing, still I am in want of nothing.” “But I,” said he, “unhappily,
can no longer find anybody who will feed me in exchange for making me
the butt of his jokes.” “What!” said I, “do you suppose it is managed
by those means? You are quite mistaken. Once upon a time, in the
early ages, there was a calling of that sort; but I will tell you a
new mode of coney-catching; I, in fact, have been the first to strike
into this path. There is a class of men who strive to be the first
in everything, but are not; to these I pay my court. I do not offer
myself to them to be laughed at, but I am the first to laugh with
them, and at the same time to admire their parts. Whatever they say,
I commend; if they contradict that selfsame thing, I commend again.
Does any one deny? I deny; does he affirm? I affirm. In fine, I have
so trained myself as to humor them in everything. This calling is now
by far the most productive.” While we were thus talking, we arrived
at the market-place. Overjoyed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span> all the confectioners ran at once to
meet me; fishmongers, butchers, cooks, sausage-makers, fishermen, whom,
both when my fortunes were flourishing and when they were ruined, I
had served, and often serve still; they complimented me, asked me to
dinner, and gave me a hearty welcome. When this poor hungry wretch
saw that I was in such great esteem, and that I obtained a living so
easily, then the fellow began to entreat me that I would allow him
to learn this method of me. So I bade him become my follower&mdash;if he
could. As the disciples of the philosophers take their names from the
philosophers themselves, so, too, the Parasites ought to be called
Gnathonites.&mdash;<i>Eunuchus.</i></p>

<p>At the beginning of the Christian Era, Roman Literature writers had
begun to come into their own, and the first century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> saw
many of the greatest Romans of them all in the paths of Literature.</p>

<p>Catullus, the blithe poet who left us some hundred or so of his poems,
frequently wrote lines more lyrical than chaste. Yet he himself bids
us remember that if a poet’s life be chaste, his lines need not
necessarily be so, too.</p>

<p>As Herrick later put it, “Jocund his muse was, but his life was chaste.”</p>

<p>But the self-revelations of Catullus are probably no more improper to
read than those of many later and lesser poets.</p>

<p>His Trimalchio’s Dinner offers this:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span></p>


<h4><i>AN INGENIOUS COOK</i></h4>

<p class="p1">We little thought, as the saying is, that after so many dainties we had
another hill to climb; for the table being uncovered to a flourish of
music, three muzzled white hogs were brought in, with bells hanging on
their necks. The man leading them said one was two years old, the other
three, and the last full grown. For my part, I took them for acrobats,
and imagined the hogs were to perform some of the surprising feats
practised at the circus. But Trimalchio broke in upon our expectation
by asking us, “Which of these will you have dressed for supper? Cocks
and pheasants are country fare, but my cooks have pans in which a
calf can be roasted whole.” And immediately commanding a cook to be
called, Trimalchio, without waiting for our choice, bade him kill the
largest. He then inquired of the cook how he came by him saying, “Were
you bought, or were you born in my house?” “Neither,” replied the
cook, “but left you by Pansa’s testament.” “Then see to it,” answered
Trimalchio, “that this beast is prepared quickly, or I shall make you
serve my footmen.” ...</p>

<p>While our host was talking on, an overgrown hog was brought to table.
We all wondered at the expedition which had been used, swearing a
capon could not have been dressed in that time; and what increased
our surprise was that this hog seemed larger than the boar which
had been set before us. Trimalchio, after gazing steadfastly upon
him, exclaimed, “What! have his entrails not been taken out? No, by
Hercules, they have not! Bring in that rogue of a cook!” The cook,
being dragged in before us, hung his head, excusing himself that he
had forgotten. “Forgotten!” roared his master. “Strip the rascal!
Strip him!” The poor man was stripped forthwith, and placed between
two tormentors. We all interceded for him, alleging that such an error
might occasionally happen, and therefore desired his pardon, protesting
we would never speak for him if he repeated the same offense.</p>

<p>I thought he richly deserved his fate, and could not forbear whispering
to Agamemnon, “This must certainly be a most careless rascal. How could
any one forget to disembowel a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span> hog? I would not have forgiven him,
by Hercules, had he thus served up a dish for me!” Our host, resuming
a pleasant look, said, “Come, now, you with the short memory, let us
see if you can disembowel the animal before us.” Upon which the cook,
having put his garments on again, took his knife, and with a trembling
hand slashed the hog on both sides of the belly, when out tumbled a
load of hog’s-puddings and sausages....</p>

<p>The dessert consisted of a blackbird pie, dried grapes, and candied
nuts. There were also quinces, stuck so full of spices that they looked
like so many hedgehogs. Yet all this might have been endured, had not
the next dish been so monstrous and disgusting that we would rather
have perished of hunger than touched it; for, it being placed upon
the table, and, as we imagined, a good fat goose, with fish and all
kinds of fowl round it, Trimalchio cried, “Whatever you see here is
all made out of one body!” I, being a cunning spark, took a guess at
what it might really be, and, turning to Agamemnon, “I wonder,” said
I, “whether all this is not made of loam? I once remember seeing such
an imaginary dish in the Saturnalia at Rome.” Scarce had I ended, when
Trimalchio began to praise his cook:</p>

<p>“There is no cleverer fellow in the world. Out of the belly he’ll make
you a dish of fish; a plover out of a piece of fat bacon; a turtle out
of leg of pork; and a hen out of the intestines. And therefore, in my
opinion, he has a very suitable name, for we call him Dædalus. Because
he is such an ingenious fellow, a friend of his brought him a present
of knives from Rome, of German steel; and immediately he called for
them, and, turning them over, gave us the liberty to try the edges on
his cheeks.”</p>

<p>Just then in rushed two servants in high dispute, as if they were
quarreling about a yoke, from which hung two earthen jars. And when
Trimalchio had judged between them, neither of them stood to the
sentence, but each fell to club law, and broke the other’s jar. Amazed
at the insolence of these drunken rascals, all our eyes were fixed on
their conflict, when we perceived oysters and other shell-fish to fall
from the broken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span> jars, a boy collecting them in a charger and handing
them about among the guests.</p>

<p>Nor was the cook’s ingenuity in the least unworthy of this
extraordinary magnificence; for he brought us snails upon a silver
gridiron, and with a shrill, unpleasant voice sang us a song.... We
were almost pushed off our couches by the crowd of servants who rushed
into the hall; and who should be seated above me but the ingenious
cook, that had made a goose from a piece of pork, all reeking of
pickles and kitchen slops. Not content with being seated at table,
he began to act Thespis the Tragedian; and soon after he challenged
his master to contend with him for the laurel wreath at the next
chariot-races.</p>

<p class="r2 p-min">&mdash;<i>Trimalchio’s Banquet.</i></p>

<p>Persius, who died at twenty-eight, left us six satires. Though an
imperfect imitator of Horace, his work is characterized by earnestness
and a true sense of satire.</p>

<p>In Martial we find a humorist after our own heart. As Homer was the
father of poetry and Herodotus the father of prose, so to Martial must
be ascribed the paternity of the epigram.</p>

<p>Epigrams, so-called, had been made before, but in Martial’s work they
rose to a new height, took on a new meaning.</p>

<p>Before Martial, epigram meant merely inscription,&mdash;any short poem that
might conveniently be cut on stone.</p>

<p>Martial’s epigrams have keen wit and sharp point, such as appeal to the
mind and appreciation of the reader.</p>

<p>Fourteen hundred and fifty is his legacy of epigrams to us, and most of
them properly short, as an epigram should be.</p>

<p>Apuleius was the skilful teller of a long and fantastic tale called
Metamorphoses, commonly known as the Golden Ass.</p>

<p>But a small extract may be given.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Apuleius</span><br />
<span class="subhed"><i>METAMORPHOSES</i></span></h4>

<p>Fotis came running to me one day in great excitement and trepidation,
and informed me that her mistress, having hitherto made no proficiency
by other means in her present amour, intended to assume feathers like
a bird, and so take flight to the object of her love, and that I must
prepare myself with all due care for the sight of such a wonderful
proceeding. And now, about the first watch of the night, she escorted
me, on tiptoe and with noiseless steps, to that same upper chamber, and
bade me peep through a chink in the door, which I did accordingly.</p>

<p>In the first place, Pamphile divested herself of all her garments,
and having unlocked a certain cabinet, took out of it several little
boxes. Taking the lid off one of them, and pouring some ointment
therefrom, she rubbed herself for a considerable time with her hands,
smearing herself all over from the tips of her toes to the crown of
her head. Then, after she had muttered a long while in a low voice
over a lamp, she shook her limbs with tremulous jerks, then gently
waved them to and fro, until soft feathers burst forth, strong wings
displayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span> themselves, the nose was hardened and curved into a beak,
the nails were compressed and made crooked. Thus did Pamphile become an
owl. Then, uttering a querulous scream, she made trial of her powers,
leaping little by little from the ground; and presently, raising
herself aloft, on full wing, she flew out-of-doors. And thus was she,
of her own will, changed, by her own magic arts.</p>

<p>But I, though not enchanted by any magic spell, still, riveted to
the spot by astonishment at this performance, seemed to myself to be
anything else rather than Lucius. Thus deprived of my senses, and
astounded even to insanity, I was in a waking dream, and rubbed my eyes
for some time to ascertain whether or not I was awake at all. At last,
however, returning to consciousness of the reality of things, I took
hold of the right hand of Fotis, and putting it to my eyes, “Suffer
me,” said I, “I beg of you, to enjoy a great and singular proof of your
affection, while the opportunity offers, and give me a little ointment
from the same box. Grant this, my sweetest, I entreat you by these
breasts of yours, and thus, by conferring on me an obligation that can
never be repaid, bind me to you forever as your slave. Be you my Venus,
and let me stand by you a winged Cupid.”</p>

<p>“And are you, then, sweetheart, for playing me a fox’s trick, and for
causing me, of my own accord, to let fall the ax upon my legs? Must
I run such risk of having my Lucius torn from me by the wolves of
Thessaly? Where am I to look for him when he is changed into a bird?
When shall I see him again?”</p>

<p>“May the celestial powers,” said I, “avert from me such a crime! Though
borne aloft on the wings of the eagle itself, soaring through the
midst of the heavens, as the trusty messenger, or joyous arm-bearer,
of supreme Jove, would I not, after I had obtained this dignity of
wing, still fly back every now and then to my nest? I swear to you,
by that lovely little knot of hair with which you have enchanted my
spirit, that I would prefer no other to my Fotis. And then, besides, I
bethink me that as soon as I am rubbed with that ointment, and shall
have been changed into a bird of this kind, I shall be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span> bound to keep
at a distance from all human habitations; for what a beautiful and
agreeable lover will the ladies gain in an owl! Why, do we not see that
these birds of night, when they have got into any house, are eagerly
seized and nailed to the doors, in order that they may atone, by
their torments, for the evil destiny which they portend to the family
by their inauspicious flight? But one thing I had almost forgot to
inquire: what must I say, or do, in order to get rid of my wings and
return to my own form as Lucius?”</p>

<p>“Be in no anxiety,” she said, “about all that matter; for my mistress
has made me acquainted with everything that can again change such forms
into the human shape. But do not suppose that this was done through any
kind feeling toward me, but in order that I might assist her with the
requisite remedies when she returns home. Only think with what simple
and trifling herbs such a mighty result is brought about: for instance,
a little anise, with some leaves of laurel infused in spring water, and
used as a lotion and a draft.”</p>

<p>Having assured me of this over and over again, she stole into her
mistress’s chamber with the greatest trepidation, and took a little
box out of the casket. Having first hugged and kissed it, and offered
up a prayer that it would favor me with a prosperous flight, I hastily
divested myself of all my garments, then greedily dipping my fingers
into the box, and taking thence a considerable quantity of the
ointment, I rubbed it all over my body and limbs. And now, flapping my
arms up and down, I anxiously awaited my change into a bird. But no
down, no shooting wings appeared. Instead, my hairs became thickened
into bristles, and my tender skin was hardened into a hide; my hands
and feet, too, no longer furnished with distinct fingers and toes,
formed into massive hoofs, and a long tail projected from the extremity
of my spine. My face was now enormous, my mouth wide, my nostrils
gaping, and my lips hanging down. In like manner my ears grew hairy
and of immoderate length, and I found in every respect I had become
enlarged. Thus, hopelessly surveying all parts of my body, I beheld
myself changed&mdash;not into a bird, but an ass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span></p>

<p>I wished to upbraid Fotis for the deed she had done; but, now deprived
both of the gesture and voice of man, I could only expostulate with her
silently with my under-lip hanging down, and looking sidewise at her
with tearful eyes. As for her, as soon as she beheld me thus changed
she beat her face with her hands, and cried aloud, “Wretch that I am,
I am undone! In my haste and flurry I mistook one box for the other,
deceived by their similarity. It is fortunate, however, that a remedy
for this transformation is easily to be obtained; for, by only chewing
roses, you will put off the form of an ass, and in an instant will
become my Lucius once again. I only wish that I had prepared as usual
some garlands of roses for us last evening; for then you would not have
had to suffer the delay even of a single night. But at the break of
dawn the remedy shall be provided for you.”</p>

<p>Thus did she lament; and as for me, though I was a perfect ass, and
instead of Lucius, a beast of burden, I still retained human sense.
Long and deeply, in fact, did I consider with myself whether I ought
not to bite and kick that most wicked woman to death. However, better
thoughts recalled me from such rash designs, lest, by inflicting on
Fotis the punishment of death, I should at once put an end to all
chances of efficient assistance. So, bending my head low, and shaking
my ears, I silently swallowed my wrongs for a time, and submitting
to my most dreadful misfortune, I betook myself to the stable to the
good horse which had carried me so well, and there I found another
ass also, which belonged to my former host, Milo. Now it occurred to
me that, if there are in dumb animals any silent and natural ties of
sympathy, this horse of mine, being influenced by a certain feeling
of recognition and compassion, would afford me room for a lodging and
the rights of hospitality. But, oh, Jupiter Hospitalis, and all you
the guardian divinities of Faith! this very excellent nag of mine and
the ass put their heads together and immediately plotted schemes for
my destruction; and as soon as they beheld me approaching the manger,
laying back their ears and quite frantic with rage, they furiously
attacked me with their heels, fearing I had design upon their food.
Consequently, I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span> driven away into the farthest corner from that
very barley which the evening before I had placed, with my own hands,
before that most grateful servant of mine.</p>

<p>Thus harshly treated and sent into banishment, I betook myself to a
corner of the stable. And while I reflected on the insolence of my
companions, and formed plans of vengeance against the perfidious steed,
for the next day, when I should have become Lucius once more by the
aid of the roses, I beheld against the central square pillar which
supported the beams of the stable, a statue of the goddess Hippona,
standing within a shrine, and nicely adorned with garlands of roses,
and those, too, recently gathered. Inspired with hope, the moment I
espied the salutary remedy I boldly mounted as far as ever my forelegs
could stretch; and then, with neck at full length, and extending my
lips as much as I possibly could, I endeavored to catch hold of the
garlands. But by a most unlucky chance, just as I was endeavoring to
accomplish this, my servant lad, who had the constant charge of my
horse, suddenly espied me, sprang to his feet in a great rage, and
exclaimed, “How long are we to put up with this vile hack, which but a
few moments ago was for making an attack upon the food of the cattle,
and is now doing the same even to the statues of the gods? But if I
don’t this very instant cause this sacrilegious beast to be both sore
and crippled”&mdash;and searching for something with which to strike me, he
stumbled upon a bundle of sticks that lay there, and, picking out a
knotted cudgel, the largest he could find among them all, he did not
cease to belabor my poor sides, until a loud thumping and banging at
the outer gates, and an uproar of the neighbors shouting “Thieves!”
struck him with terror, and he took to his heels.</p>

<p class="r2 p-min">&mdash;<i>The Golden Ass.</i></p>


<h4><i>VICISSITUDES OF A DONKEY</i></h4>

<p>When the keeper of the horses had taken me to the country, I found
there none of the pleasure or the liberty I expected; for his wife,
an avaricious, bad woman, immediately yoked me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span> to the mill, and
frequently striking me with a green stick, prepared bread for herself
and her family at the expense of my hide. And not content to make me
drudge for her own food only, she also ground corn for her neighbors,
and so made money by my toil. Nor, after all my weary labors, did she
even afford me the food which had been ordered for me; for she sold my
barley to the neighboring husbandmen, after it had been bruised and
ground in that very mill by my own roundabout drudgery; but to me,
who had worked during the whole of the day at that laborious machine,
she only gave, toward evening, some dirty, unsifted, and very gritty
bran. I was brought low enough by these miseries; but cruel fortune
exposed me to fresh torments, in order, I suppose, that I might boast
of my brave deeds, both in peace and war, as the saying is. For that
excellent equerry, complying, rather late, indeed, with his master’s
orders, for a short time permitted me to associate with the herds of
horses.</p>

<p>At length a free ass, I capered for joy, and softly ambling up to
the mares, chose out such as I thought would be the fittest for my
concubines. But here my joyful hopes gave place to extreme danger. For
the stallions, who were terribly strong creatures, more than a match
for any ass, regarding me with suspicion, furiously pursued me as
their rival, without respect for the laws of hospitable Jupiter. One
of them, with his head and neck and ample chest aloft, struck at me
like a pugilist with his forefeet; another, turning his brawny back,
let fly at me with his hind feet; and another, with a vicious neigh,
his ears thrown back, and showing his white teeth, sharp as spears,
bit me all over. It was like what I have read in history of the King
of Thrace, who exposed his unhappy guests to be lacerated and devoured
by wild horses; for so sparing was that powerful tyrant of his barley,
that he appeased the hunger of his voracious horses by casting human
bodies to them for food. In fact, I was so worried and distracted by
the continual attacks of the horses, that I wished myself back again at
the mill-round.</p>

<p>Fortune, however, would not be satisfied with my torments, and soon
after visited me with another calamity; for I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span> was employed to bring
home wood from a mountain, and a boy, the most villainous of all boys,
was appointed to drive me. It was not only that I was wearied by
toiling up and down the steep and lofty mountain, nor that I wore away
my hoofs by running on sharp stones, but I was cudgeled without end, so
that all my bones ached to the very marrow. Moreover, by continually
striking me on the off-haunch, and always in the same place, till
the skin was broken, he occasioned a great ulcerous cavity, gaping
like a trench or a window; yet he never ceased to hit me on the raw.
He likewise laid such a load of wood on my back that you might have
thought it was a burden prepared for an elephant, and not for a donkey.
And whenever the ill-balanced load inclined to one side, instead of
taking away some of the fagots from the heavier side, and thus easing
me by somewhat lightening, or at least equalizing the pressure, he
always remedied the inequality of the weight by the addition of stones.
Nor yet, after so many miseries which I had endured, was he content
with the immoderate weight of my burden; but when it happened that we
had to pass over a river, he would leap on my back in order to keep his
feet dry, as if his weight was but a trifling addition to the heavy
mass. And if by any accident I happened to fall, through the weight of
my burden and the slipperiness of the muddy bank, instead of giving
me a helping hand, as he ought to have done, and pulling me up by the
head-stall, or by my tail, or removing a part of my load, till at least
I had got up again, this paragon of ass-drivers gave me no help at all,
however weary I might be, but beginning from my head, or rather from my
ears, he thrashed all the hair off my hide with a huge stick.</p>

<p>Another piece of cruelty he practised on me was this: he twisted
together a bundle of the sharpest and most venomous thorns, and tied
them to my tail as a pendulous torment; so that, jerking against me
when I walked, they pricked and stabbed me intolerably. Hence, I
was in a sore dilemma; for when I ran away from him, to escape his
unmerciful drubbings, I was hurt by the more vehement pricking of
the thorns; and if I stood still for a short time, in order to avoid
that pain, I was compelled by blows to go on. In fact, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span> rascally
boy seemed to think of nothing else than how he might be the death
of me by some means or other; and that he sometimes threatened with
oaths to accomplish. And, indeed, there happened a thing by which his
detestable malice was stimulated to more baneful efforts. On a certain
day, when his excessive insolence had overcome my patience, I lifted
up my powerful heels against him; and for this he retaliated by the
following atrocity: he brought me into the road heavily laden with a
bundle of coarse flax, securely bound together with cords, and placed
in the middle of the burden a burning coal, which he had stolen from
the neighboring village. Presently the fire spread through the slender
fibers, flames burst forth, and I was ablaze all over. There appeared
no refuge from immediate destruction, no hope of safety, and such a
conflagration did not admit of delay or afford time for deliberation.
Fortune, however, shone upon me in these cruel circumstances&mdash;perhaps
for the purpose of reserving me for future dangers, but, at all events,
liberating me from present and decreed death. By chance perceiving a
neighboring pool muddy with the rain of the preceding day, I threw
myself headlong into it; and the flame being immediately extinguished,
I came out, lightened of my burden and liberated from destruction. But
that audacious young rascal cast the blame of this most wicked deed of
his on me, and affirmed to all the shepherds that as I was passing near
the neighbors’ fires, I stumbled on purpose, and threw my load into the
blaze. And he added, laughing at me, “How long shall we waste food on
this fiery monster?”</p>

  </div>

<p class="p-left">gives no stronger or more absolute effect of darkness and blankness
than the state of humorous literature during the vast deep and middle
of the Mediæval Ages.</p>

<p>It is not possible to catalogue it with reference to time or place, for
the mass of it came from the mouths of Tale-tellers or Song-singers,
supplemented by the pencils or chisels of the caricaturists.</p>

<p>In the East, Folk Tales were abundant and they were brought to Europe
as the wind scatters the seeds of vegetation.</p>

<p>Fables, Fairy Tales, Mother Goose Jingles, Collections of Anecdotes,
all hark back to these jesting stories of the ancient Orientals.</p>

<p>Probably the oldest and most important link in the tracing of
Indo-European Folk Lore is found in the Fables of Pilpay, or Bidpai.</p>

<p>This is the Arabic translation of the Pahlavi translation of the
Sanscrit original of the Panchatantra.</p>

<p>The scope of the work is advice for the conduct of princes, offered in
the guise of beast fables, and perhaps containing much of the material
commonly attributed to Æsop.</p>

<p>Little or nothing is known of Pilpay, and his era has been variously
placed at different dates between 100 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> and 300
<span class="smcap">b.c</span>.</p>

<p>Others, indeed, declare that Pilpay was not an individual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span> but the name
is that of a bidbah, the court scholar of an Indian prince.</p>

<p>The fables, as may be seen from the following selections, inculcate
the moral teachings by means of stories about animals, to whom are
attributed the thoughts and impulses of men.</p>

<p>Kalidasa, called the greatest poet and dramatist of India, is also
of uncertain origin and birth date. He probably lived early in the
Christian Era, and his writings, though not strictly humorous are
instinct with the spirit of satire.</p>

<p><i>Mathavya.</i> Heigh-ho, what an unfortunate fellow I am, worn to a
shadow by my royal friend’s sporting propensities! “Here’s a deer!”
“There goes a boar!” “Yonder’s a tiger!” This is the constant subject
of his remarks, while we tramp about in the heat of the day from jungle
to jungle on paths where the trees give us no shade. If we are thirsty,
we can get nothing to drink but some dirty water from a mountain stream
full of dry leaves, tasting vilely bitter. If we are hungry, we are
obliged to eat tough, flavorless game, and have to gulp it down at
odd times as best we can. Even at night I have no peace. Sleeping is
out of the question, with my bones all aching from trotting after my
sporting friend; or, if I do contrive to doze, I am awakened at early
dawn by the horrible din of a lot of rascally beaters and huntsmen,
who must needs begin their deafening operations before sunrise. But
these are not my only troubles; for here’s a fresh grievance, like
a new boil rising upon an old one: Yesterday, while some of us were
lagging behind, my royal friend went into a hermit’s enclosure after a
deer, and there&mdash;worse luck&mdash;he caught sight of a beautiful girl called
Sakuntala, the hermit’s daughter. From that moment not a single thought
did he have of returning to town; and all night long not a wink of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
sleep did he get for his thoughts of the girl. But see&mdash;here he comes!
I will pretend to stand in the easiest attitude for resting my bruised

bent crooked by its own act, or by the force of the current?</p>

<p><i>King.</i> The current of the river is the cause, I suppose.</p>

<p><i>Mathavya.</i> Yes, just as you are the cause of my crippled limbs.</p>

<p><i>King.</i> How so?</p>

<p><i>Mathavya.</i> Here you are, living the life of a savage in a
desolate, forlorn region, while the government of the country is taking
care of itself. And poor I am no longer master of my own legs, but have
to follow you about day after day in your hunting for wild beasts, till

<span class="subhed"><i>THE CREATION OF WOMAN</i></span></h4>

<p class="p1">In the beginning, when Twashtri came to the creation of women, he found
that he had exhausted his materials in the making of man, and that no
solid elements were left. In this dilemma, after profound meditation,
he did as follows:</p>

<p>He took the rotundity of the moon, and the curves of creepers and the
clinging of tendrils, and the trembling of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span> grass, and the slenderness
of the reed, and the bloom of flowers, and the lightness of leaves,
and the tapering of the elephant’s trunk, and the glances of deer,
and the joyous gaiety of sunbeams, and the weeping of clouds, and
the fickleness of the winds, and the timidity of the hare, and the
vanity of the peacock, and the softness of the parrot’s bosom, and the
hardness of adamant, and the cruelty of the tiger, and the hot glow of
fire, and the coldness of snow, and the chattering of jays, and the
cooing of the dove, and the hypocrisy of the crane, and the fidelity of
the drake. Compounding all these together, he made woman, and gave her
to man.</p>

<p>But after a week man came to him, and said:</p>

<p>“Lord, this creature that you have given me makes my life miserable.
She chatters incessantly, and teases me beyond endurance, never leaving
me alone. She requires attention every moment, takes up all my time,
weeps about nothing, and is always idle. So I have come to give her
back again, as I cannot live with her.”</p>

<p>Then Twashtri said, “Very well,” and took her back.</p>

<p>After another week man came to him again, saying:</p>

<p>“Lord, I find that my life is lonely since I surrendered that creature.
I remember how she used to dance and sing to me, and look at me out of
the corner of her eye, and play with me, and cling to me. Her laughter
was music; she was beautiful to look at, and soft to touch. Pray give
her back to me again.”</p>

<p>And Twashtri said, “Very well,” and returned woman to man.</p>

<p>But after only three days had passed, man appeared once more before the
Creator, to whom he said:</p>

<p>“Lord, I know not how it is, but, after all, I have come to the
conclusion that she is more trouble than pleasure to me. Therefore I
beg that you take her back again.”</p>

<p>Twashtri, however, replied:</p>

<p>“Out upon you! Be off! I will have no more of this. You must manage how
you can.”</p>

<p>Then quoth man:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span></p>

<p>“But I cannot live with her!”</p>

<p>To which Twashtri answered:</p>

<p>“Neither could you live without her.” And he turned his back on man,
and went on with his work.</p>

<p>Then said man:</p>

<p>“Alas, what is to be done? For I cannot live either with
or without her!”&mdash;<i>The Churning of the Ocean of Time</i>
(<i>Sansara-sagara-manthanam</i>).</p>

<p>The Talmud is far from a humorous work, but it embodies many bits of
wise wit, and is the original source of many present day proverbs.</p>

<p>In its twelve folio volumes it contains the work of the ancient
Jews for nearly a thousand years, and among its fine parables and
interesting legends gleams of rare wit frequently occur.</p>

<p class="p1">The forest trees once asked the fruit trees: “Why is the rustling of
your leaves not heard in the distance?” The fruit trees replied: “We
can dispense with the rustling to manifest our presence, our fruits
testify for us.” The fruit trees then inquired of the forest trees:
“Why do your leaves rustle almost continually?” “We are forced to call
the attention of man to our existence.”</p>

<p>If thy friends agree in calling thee an ass, go and get a halter around
thee.</p>

<p>Love your wife truly and faithfully, and do not compel her to hard work.</p>

<p>When our conjugal love was strong, the width of the threshold offered
sufficient accommodation for both of us; but now that it has cooled

<p>If the thief has no opportunity, he thinks himself honorable.</p>

<p>What should man do in order to live? Deaden his passions. What should

gold. Several dealers saw the jewel and offered five gold pieces.
Rab Safra declined, and the merchants left him. After a second
consideration, he, however, resolved upon selling the jewel for five
pieces. The next day, just as Rab Safra was at prayers, the merchants
unexpectedly returned: “Sir,” said they to him, “we come to you again
to do business after all. Do you wish to part with the jewel for the
price we offered you?” But Rab Safra made no reply. “Well, well; be
not angered; we will add another two pieces.” Rab Safra still remained
silent. “Well, then, be it as you say; we will give you ten pieces,
the price you asked.” By this time Rab Safra had ended his prayer,
and said: “Sirs, I was at prayers, and could not hear you. As for the
jewel, I have already resolved upon selling it at the price you offered
me yesterday. If you then pay me five pieces of gold, I shall be
satisfied.”</p>

five or six centuries ago.</p>

Scheherazade, to preserve her life so long as the king’s interest might

wearisome, many more too broad to quote, but several are given that may
be considered as representative of Oriental wit.</p>


<h4><i>THE SIMPLETON AND THE SHARPER</i></h4>

<p class="p1">A certain simple fellow was once going along, haling his ass after
him by the halter, when a couple of sharpers saw him and one said to
his fellow, “I will take that ass from yonder man.” “How wilt thou do
that?” asked the other. “Follow me and I will show thee,” replied the
first. So he went up to the ass and loosing it from the halter, gave
the beast to his fellow; then clapped the halter on his own head and
followed the simpleton, till he knew that the other had got clean off
with the ass when he stood still. The man pulled at the halter, but the
thief stirred not; so he turned and seeing the halter on a man’s neck,
said to him, “Who art thou?” Quoth the sharper, “I am thine ass and my
story is a strange one. Know that I have a pious old mother and came
in to her one day, drunk; and she said to me, “O my son, repent to God
the Most High of these thy transgressions.” But I took the cudgel and
beat her, whereupon she cursed me and God the Most High changed me into
an ass and caused me fall into thy hands, where I have remained till
now. However, today, my mother called me to mind and her heart relented
towards me; so she prayed for me, and God restored me to my former
shape of a man.” “There is no power and no virtue but in God the Most
High, the Supreme!” cried the simpleton. “O my brother, I conjure thee
by Allah acquit me of what I have done with thee in the way of riding
and so forth.”</p>

<p>Then he let the sharper go and returned home, drunken with chagrin and
concern. His wife asked him, “What ails thee and where is the ass?”
And he answered, “Thou knowest not what was this ass; but I will tell
thee.” So he told her the story, and she exclaimed, “Woe worth us
for God the Most High! How could we have used a man as a beast of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
burden, all this while?” And she gave alms and asked pardon of God.
Then the man abode awhile at home, idle, till she said to him, “How
long wilt thou sit at home, idle? Go to the market and buy us an ass
and do thy business with it.” Accordingly, he went to the market and
stopping by the ass-stand, saw his own ass for sale. So he went up to
it and clapping his mouth to its ear, said to it, “Out on thee, thou
good-for-nought! Doubtless thou hast been getting drunk again and
beating thy mother! But, by Allah, I will never buy thee more!” And he
left it and went away.</p>


<h4><i>THE THIEF TURNED MERCHANT AND THE OTHER THIEF</i></h4>

<p class="p1">There was once a thief who repented to God the Most High and making
good his repentance, opened himself a shop for the sale of stuffs,
where he continued to trade awhile. One day, he locked his shop and
went home; and in the night there came to the bazaar a cunning thief
disguised in the habit of the merchant, and pulling out keys from his
sleeve, said to the watchman of the market, “Light me this candle.”
So the watchman took the candle and went to get a light, whilst the
thief opened the shop and lit another candle he had with him. When
the watchman came back, he found him seated in the shop, looking over
the account books and reckoning with his fingers; nor did he leave
to do thus till point of day, when he said to the man, “Fetch me a
camel-driver and his camel, to carry some goods for me.” So the man
fetched him a camel, and the thief took four bales of stuffs and gave
them to the camel-driver, who loaded them on his beast. Then he gave
the watchman two dirhems and went away after the camel-driver, the
watchman the while believing him to be the owner of the shop.</p>

<p>Next morning, the merchant came and the watchman greeted him with
blessings, because of the two dirhems, much to the surprise of the
former, who knew not what he meant. When he opened his shop, he saw
the droppings of the wax and the account-book lying on the floor, and
looking round, found four bales of stuffs missing. So he asked the
watchman what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span> had happened and he told him what had passed in the
night, whereupon the merchant bade him fetch the camel-driver and
said to the latter, “Whither didst thou carry the stuffs?” “To such
a wharf,” answered the driver; “and I stowed them on board such a
vessel.” “Come with me thither,” said the merchant. So the camel-driver
carried him to the wharf and showed him the barque and her owner. Quoth
the merchant to the latter, “Whither didst thou carry the merchant and
the stuff?” “To such a place,” answered the master, “where he fetched
a camel-driver and setting the bales on the camel, went I know not
whither.” “Fetch me the camel-driver,” said the merchant; so he fetched
him and the merchant said to him, “Whither didst thou carry the bales
of stuffs from the ship?” “To such a khan,” answered he. “Come thither
with me and show it to me,” said the merchant.</p>

<p>So the camel-driver went with him to a khan at a distance from the
shore, where he had set down the stuffs, and showed him the mock
merchant’s magazine, which he opened and found therein his four bales
untouched and unopened. The thief had laid his mantle over them; so
the merchant took the bales and the cloak and delivered them to the
camel-driver, who laid them on his camel; after which the merchant
locked the magazine and went away with the camel-driver. On the way, he
met the thief who followed him, till he had shipped the bales, when he
said to him “O my brother (God have thee in His keeping!), thou hast
recovered thy goods, and nought of them is lost; so give me back my
cloak.” The merchant laughed and giving him back his cloak, let him go
unhindered.</p>


<h4><i>THE IGNORANT MAN WHO SET UP FOR A SCHOOLMASTER</i></h4>

<p class="p1">There was once, among the hangers-on of the collegiate mosque, a man
who knew not how to read and write and got his bread by gulling the
folk. One day, he bethought him to open a school and teach children;
so he got him tablets and written scrolls and hung them up in a
conspicuous place. Then he enlarged his turban and sat down at the door
of the school. The people, who passed by and saw his turban and the
tablets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span> and scrolls, thought he must be a very learned doctor; so they
brought him their children; and he would say to this, “Write,” and to
that, “Read”; and thus they taught one another.</p>

<p>One day, as he sat, as of wont, at the door of the school, he saw a
woman coming up, with a letter in her hand, and said to himself, “This
woman doubtless seeks me, that I may read her the letter she has in her
hand. How shall I do with her seeing I cannot read writing?” And he
would fain have gone down and fled from her; but, before he could do
this, she overtook him and said to him, “Whither away?” Quoth he, “I
purpose to pray the noontide-prayer and return.” “Noon is yet distant,”
said she; “so read me this letter.” He took the letter and turning
it upside down, fell to looking at it, now shaking his head and anon
knitting his eyebrows and showing concern. Now the letter came from
the woman’s husband, who was absent; and when she saw the schoolmaster
do thus, she said, “Doubtless my husband is dead, and this learned man
is ashamed to tell me so.” So she said to him, “O my lord, if he be
dead, tell me.” But he shook his head and held his peace. Then said
she, “Shall I tear my clothes?” “Tear,” answered he. “Shall I buffet my
face,” asked she; and he said, “Buffet.” So she took the letter from
his hand and returning home, fell a-weeping, she and her children.</p>

<p>One of her neighbours heard her weeping and asking what ailed her, was
answered, “She hath gotten a letter, telling her that her husband is
dead.” Quoth the man, “This is a lying saying; for I had a letter from
him but yesterday, advising me that he is in good health and case and
will be with her after ten days.” So he rose forthright and going in
to her, said, “Where is the letter thou hast received?” She brought
it to him, and he took it and read it; and it ran as follows, after
the usual salutation, “I am well and in good health and case and will
be with thee after ten days. Meanwhile, I send thee a quilt and an
extinguisher.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> So she took the letter and returning with it to the
schoolmaster, said to him, “What moved thee to deal thus with me?” And
she repeated to him what her neighbour had told her of his having sent
her a quilt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span> and an extinguisher. “Thou art in the right,” answered
he. “But excuse me, good woman; for I was, at the time, troubled and
absent-minded and seeing the extinguisher wrapped in the quilt, thought
that he was dead and they had shrouded him.” The woman, not smoking the
cheat, said, “Thou art excused,” and taking the letter, went away.</p>


<h4><i>THE HUSBAND AND THE PARROT</i></h4>

<p class="p1">There lived once a good man who had a beautiful wife, of whom he was
so passionately fond that he could scarcely bear to have her out of
his sight. One day, when some particular business obliged him to leave
her, he went to a place where they sold all sorts of birds. Here he
purchased a parrot, which was not only highly accomplished in the art
of talking, but also possessed the rare gift of telling everything that
was done in its presence. The husband took it home in a cage to his
wife, and begged of her to keep it in her chamber, and take great care
of it during his absence. After this he set out on his journey.</p>

<p>On his return he did not fail to interrogate the parrot on what had
passed while he was away; and the bird very expertly related a few
circumstances which occasioned the husband to reprimand his wife.
She supposed that some of her slaves had betrayed her, but they all
assured her they were faithful, and agreed in charging the parrot with
the crime. Desirous of being convinced of the truth of this matter,
the wife devised a method of quieting the suspicions of her husband,
and at the same time of revenging herself on the parrot, if he were
the culprit. The next time the husband was absent she ordered one
of her slaves during the night to turn a handmill under the bird’s
cage, another to throw water over it like rain, and a third to wave a
looking-glass before the parrot by the light of a candle. The slaves
were employed the greater part of the night in doing what their
mistress had ordered them, and succeeded to her satisfaction.</p>

<p>The following day, when the husband returned, he again applied to the
parrot to be informed of what had taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span> place. The bird replied, “My
dear master, the lightning, the thunder, and the rain have so disturbed
me the whole night, that, I cannot tell you how much I have suffered.”</p>

<p>The husband, who knew there had been no storm that night, became
convinced that the parrot did not always relate facts, and that having
told an untruth in this particular, he had also deceived him with
respect to his wife. Being therefore extremely enraged with it, he took
the bird out of the cage and, dashing it on the floor, killed it. He,
however, afterward learned from his neighbors that the poor parrot had
told no falsehood in reference to his wife’s conduct, which made him
repent of having destroyed it.</p>


<h4><i>BAKBARAH’S VISIT TO THE HAREM</i></h4>

<p class="p1">Bakbarah the Toothless, my second brother, walking one day through the
city, met an old woman in a retired street. She thus accosted him: “I
have,” said she, “a word to say to you, if you will stay a moment.” He
immediately stopped, and asked her what she wished. “If you have time
to go with me,” she replied, “I will take you to a most magnificent
palace, where you shall see a lady more beautiful than the day. She
will receive you with a great deal of pleasure, and will treat you with
a collation and excellent wine. I have no occasion, I believe, to say
any more.” “But is what you tell me,” replied my brother, “true?” “I
am not given to lying,” replied the old woman; “I propose nothing to
you but what is the fact. You must, however, pay attention to what I
require of you. You must be prudent, speak little, and must comply with
everything.”</p>

<p>Bakbarah having agreed to the conditions, she walked on before, and he
followed her. They arrived at the gate of a large palace, where there
were a great number of officers and servants. Some of them wished to
stop my brother, but the old woman no sooner spoke to them, than they
let him pass. She then turned to my brother, and said, “Remember that
the young lady to whose house I have brought you is fond of mildness
and modesty; nor does she like being contradicted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span> If you satisfy her
in this, there is no doubt you will obtain whatever you wish.” Bakbarah
thanked her for this advice, and promised to profit by it.</p>

<p>She then took him into a very beautiful apartment, which formed part of
a square building. It corresponded with the magnificence of the palace;
there was a gallery all round it, and in the midst of it a very fine
garden. The old woman made him sit down on a sofa that was handsomely
furnished, and desired him to wait there a moment, till she went to
inform the young lady of his arrival.</p>

<p>As my brother had never before been in so superb a place, he
immediately began to observe all the beautiful things that were in
sight; and judging of his good fortune by the magnificence he beheld,
he could hardly contain his joy. He almost immediately heard a great
noise, which came from a long troop of slaves who were enjoying
themselves, and came toward him, bursting out at the same time into
violent fits of laughter. In the midst of them he perceived a young
lady of most extraordinary beauty, whom he easily discovered to be
their mistress, by the attention they paid her. Bakbarah, who expected
merely a private conversation with the lady, was very much surprised at
the arrival of so large a company. In the meantime the slaves, putting
on a serious air, approached him; and when the young lady was near the
sofa, my brother, who had risen up, made a most profound reverence.
She took the seat of honor, and then, having requested him to resume
his, she said to him, in a smiling manner, “I am delighted to see you,
and wish you everything you can yourself desire.” “Madam,” replied
Bakbarah, “I cannot wish a greater honor than that of appearing before
you.” “You seem to me,” she replied, “of so good-humored a disposition,
that we shall pass our time very agreeably together.”</p>

<p>She immediately ordered a collation to be served up, and they covered
the table with baskets of various fruits and sweetmeats. She then sat
down at the table along with my brother and the slaves. As it happened
that he was placed directly opposite to her, she observed, as soon
as he opened his mouth to eat, he had no teeth; she remarked this to
her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span> slaves, and they all laughed immoderately at it. Bakbarah, who
from time to time raised his head to look at the lady and saw that
she was laughing, imagined it was from the pleasure she felt at being
in his company, and flattered himself, therefore, that she would soon
order the slaves to retire, and that he should enjoy her conversation
in private. The lady easily guessed his thoughts, and took a pleasure
in continuing a delusion which seemed so agreeable to him: she said a
thousand soft, tender things, and presented the best of everything to
him with her own hand.</p>

<p>When the collation was finished, she arose from table; ten slaves
instantly took some musical instruments and began to play and sing,
the others to dance. In order to make himself the more agreeable, my
brother also began dancing, and the young lady herself partook of the
amusement. After they had danced for some time, they all sat down to
take breath. The lady ordered him to bring her a glass of wine, then
cast a smile at my brother, to intimate that she was going to drink to
his health. He instantly rose up, and stood while she drank. As soon
as she had finished, instead of returning the glass, she had it filled
again, and presented it to my brother, that he might pledge her.</p>

<p>Bakbarah took the glass, and in receiving it from the young lady he
kissed her hand, then drank to her, standing the whole time, to show
his gratitude for the favor she had done him. After this the young
lady made him sit down by her side, and began to give him signs of
affection. She put her arm round his neck, and frequently gave him
gentle pats with her hand. Delighted with these favors, he thought
himself the happiest man in the world; he also was tempted to begin
to play in the same manner with this charming creature, but he durst
not take this liberty before the slaves, who had their eyes upon him,
and who continued to laugh at this trifling. The young lady still kept
giving him such gentle taps, till at last she began to apply them so
forcibly that he grew angry at it. He reddened, and got up to sit
farther from so rude a playfellow. At this moment the old woman, who
had brought my brother there, looked at him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span> in such a way as to make
him understand that he was wrong, and had forgotten the advice she had
before given him. He acknowledged his fault, and, to repair it, he
again approached the young lady, pretending that he had not gone to a
distance through anger. She then took hold of him by the arm, and drew
him toward her, making him again sit down close by her, and continuing
to bestow a thousand pretended caresses on him. Her slaves, whose only
aim was to divert her, began to take a part in the sport. One of them
gave poor Bakbarah a fillip on the nose with all her strength, another
pulled his ears almost off, while the rest kept giving him slaps, which
passed the limits of raillery and fun.</p>

<p>My brother bore all this with the most exemplary patience; he even
affected an air of gaiety, and looked at the old woman with a forced
smile. “You were right,” said he, “when you said that I should find a
very fine, agreeable, and charming young lady. How much am I obliged
to you for it!” “Oh, this is nothing yet,” replied the old woman;
“let her alone, and you will see very different things by and by.”
The young lady then spoke. “You are a fine man,” said she to my
brother, “and I am delighted at finding in you so much kindness and
complaisance toward all my little fooleries, and that you possess
a disposition so conformable to mine.” “Madam,” replied Bakbarah,
ravished with this speech, “I am no longer myself, but am entirely at
your disposal; you have full power to do with me as you please.” “You
afford me the greatest delight,” added the lady, “by showing so much
submission to my inclination. I am perfectly satisfied with you, and I
wish that you should be equally so with me. Bring,” cried she to the
attendants, “perfumes and rose-water!” At these words two slaves went
out and instantly returned, one with a silver vase, in which there was
exquisite aloe-wood, with which she perfumed him, and the other with
rose-water, which she sprinkled over his face and hands. My brother
could not contain himself for joy at seeing himself so handsomely and
honorably treated.</p>

<p>When this ceremony was finished, the young lady commanded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span> the slaves
who had before sung and played to recommence their concert. They
obeyed; and while this was going on, the lady called another slave,
and ordered her to take my brother with her saying, “You know what to
do; and when you have finished, return with him to me.” Bakbarah, who
heard this order given, immediately got up, and going toward the old
woman, who had also risen to accompany the slave, he requested her to
tell him what they wished him to do. “Our mistress,” replied she, in
a whisper, “is extremely curious, and she wishes to see how you would
look disguised as a female; this slave, therefore, has orders to take
you with her, to paint your eyebrows, shave your mustachios, and dress
you like a woman.” “You may paint my eyebrows,” said my brother, “as
much as you please; to that I readily agree, because I can wash them
again; but as to shaving me, that, mind you, I will by no means suffer.
How do you think I dare appear without my mustachios?” “Take care,”
answered the woman, “how you oppose anything that is required of you.
You will quite spoil your fortune, which is going on as prosperously as
possible. She loves you, and wishes to make you happy. Will you, for
the sake of a paltry mustachio, forego the most delicious favors any
man can possibly enjoy?”</p>

<p>Bakbarah at length yielded to the old woman’s arguments, and without
saying another word, he suffered the slave to conduct him to an
apartment, where they painted his eyebrows red. They shaved his
mustachios, and were absolutely going to shave his beard. But the
easiness of my brother’s tempter did not carry him quite so far as to
suffer that. “Not a single stroke,” he exclaimed, “shall you take at
my beard!” The slave represented to him that it was of no use to have
cut off his mustachios if he would not also agree to lose his beard;
that a hairy countenance did not at all coincide with the dress of a
woman; and that she was astonished that a man, who was on the very
point of possessing the most beautiful woman in Bagdad, should care for
his beard. The old woman also joined with the slave, and added fresh
reasons; she threatened my brother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span> with being quite in disgrace with
her mistress. In short, she said so much that he at last permitted them
to do what they wished.</p>

<p>As soon as they had dressed him like a woman, they brought him back
to the young lady, who burst into so violent a fit of laughter at the
sight of him, that she fell down on the sofa on which she was sitting.
The slaves all began to clap their hands, so that my brother was put
quite out of countenance. The young lady then got up, and continuing
to laugh all the time, said, “After the complaisance you have shown to
me, I should be guilty of a crime not to bestow my whole heart upon
you; but it is necessary that you should do one thing more for love
of me: it is only to dance before me as you are.” He obeyed; and the
young lady and the slaves danced with him, laughing all the while as if
they were crazy. After they had danced for some time, they all threw
themselves upon the poor wretch, and gave him so many blows, both with
their hands and feet, that he fell down almost fainting. The old woman
came to his assistance, and without giving him time to be angry at such
ill treatment, she whispered in his ear, “Console yourself, for you
are now arrived at the conclusion of your sufferings, and are about
to receive the reward for them. You have only one thing more to do,”
added she, “and that is a mere trifle. You must know that my mistress
makes it her custom, whenever she has drunk a little, as she has done
to-day, not to suffer anyone she loves to come near her, unless they
are stripped to their shirt. When they are in this situation, she takes
advantage of a short distance, and begins running before them through
the gallery, and from room to room, till they have caught her. This is
one of her fancies. Now, at whatever distance from you she may start,
you, who are so light and active, can easily overtake her. Undress
yourself quickly, therefore, and remain in your shirt, and do not make
any difficulty about it.”</p>

<p>My brother had already carried his complying humor too far to stop
at this. The young lady at the same time took off her outer robe, in
order to run with greater ease. When they were both ready to begin the
race, the lady took the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span> advantage of about twenty paces, and then
started with wonderful celerity. My brother followed her with all
his strength, but not without exciting the risibility of the slaves,
who kept clapping their hands all the time. The young lady, instead
of losing any of the advantage she had first taken, kept continually
gaining ground of my brother. She ran round the gallery two or three
times, then turned off down a long dark passage, where she saved
herself by a turn of which my brother was ignorant. Bakbarah, who kept
constantly following her, lost sight of her in this passage, and he was
also obliged to run much slower, because it was so dark. He at last
perceived a light, toward which he made all possible haste; he went out
through a door which was instantly shut upon him.</p>

<p>You may easily imagine what was his astonishment at finding himself
in the middle of a street inhabited by curriers. Nor were they less
surprised at seeing him in his shirt, his eyebrows painted red, and
without either beard or mustachios. They began to clap their hands, to
hoot at him; and some even ran after him, and kept lashing him with
strips of their leather. They then stopped him, and set him on an ass,
which they accidentally met with, and led him through the city, exposed
to the laughter and shouts of the mob.</p>

<p>To complete his misfortune, they led him through the street where the
judge of the police court lived, and this magistrate immediately sent
to inquire the cause of the uproar. The curriers informed him that they
saw my brother, exactly in the state he then was, come out of the gate
leading to the apartments of the women belonging to the grand vizier,
which opened into their street. The judge then ordered the unfortunate
Bakbarah, upon the spot, to receive a hundred strokes on the soles of
his feet, to be conducted without the city, and forbade him ever to
enter it again.&mdash;<i>History of the Barber’s Second Brother.</i></p>

<h4><i>DISCOMFORT BETTER THAN DROWNING</i></h4>

<p class="p1">A king was embarked along with a Persian boy slave on board a ship. The
boy had never been at sea nor experienced the inconvenience of a ship.
He set up a weeping and wailing, and all his limbs were in a state
of trepidation; and however much they soothed him, he was not to be
pacified. The king’s pleasure-party was disconcerted by him; but there
was no help for it. On board that ship there was a physician. He said
to the king, “If you will order it, I can manage to silence him.” The
king replied, “It will be an act of great favor.”</p>

<p>The physician so directed that they threw the boy into the sea, and
after he had plunged repeatedly, they seized him by the hair of the
head and drew him close to the ship, when he clung with both hands to
the rudder, and, scrambling upon the deck, slunk into a corner and sat
down quiet. The king, pleased with what he saw, said, “What art is
there in this?” The boy replied that originally he had not experienced
the danger of being drowned, and undervalued the safety of being in a
ship. In like manner, a person is aware<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span> of the preciousness of health
when he is overtaken with the calamity of sickness.</p>

<h4><i>THE STRICT SCHOOLMASTER AND THE MILD</i></h4>

<p class="p1">In the west of Africa I saw a schoolmaster of a sour aspect and bitter
speech, crabbed, misanthropic, and intemperate, insomuch that the sight
of him would derange the ecstasies of the orthodox, and his manner of
reading the Koran cast a gloom over the minds of the pious. A number
of handsome boys and lovely virgins were subject to his despotic sway;
they had neither the permission of a smile nor the option of a word,
for this moment he would smite the silver cheek of one of them with his
hand, and the next put the crystalline legs of another in the stocks.
In short, their parents, I heard, were made aware of a part of his
angry violence, and beat and drove him from his charge.</p>

<p>They made over his school to a peaceable creature, so pious, meek,
simple, and good-natured that he never spoke till forced to do so, nor
would he utter a word that could offend anybody. The children forgot
that awe in which they had held their first master, and remarking the
angelic disposition of their second master, they became one after
another as wicked as devils. Relying on his clemency, they would so
neglect their studies as to pass most part of their time at play, and
break the tablets of their unfinished tasks over each other’s heads.</p>

<p><i>When the schoolmaster relaxes in his discipline, the children will
stop to play at marbles in the market-place.</i></p>

<p>A fortnight after I passed by the gate of that mosque, and saw the
first schoolmaster, with whom they had been obliged to make friends and
to restore him to his place. I was in truth offended, and calling on
God to witness, asked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span> saying, “Why have they again made a devil the
preceptor of angels?”</p>

<p>A facetious old gentleman, who had seen much of life, listened to me,
and replied, “A king sent his son to school, and hung a tablet of
silver round his neck. On the face of that tablet he had written in
golden letters, ‘The severity of the master is more useful than the
indulgence of the father.’”&mdash;<i>The Rose Garden (Gulistan).</i></p>


<h4><i>HATEFULNESS OF OLD HUSBANDS</i></h4>

<p class="p1">An old man married a young virgin. He adorned the bridal chamber with
flowers, seated himself with her in private, and riveted his heart and
eyes upon her. Many a long night he would lie awake and indulge in
pleasantries and jests, in order to remove any coyness on her part, and
encourage familiarity. One of those nights he addressed her thus:</p>

<p>“Lofty fortune was your friend, and the eye of your prosperity broad
awake, when you fell into the society of such an old gentleman as I
am, being of mature judgment, well-bred, worldly experienced, inured
to the vicissitudes of heat and cold, and practised in the goods and
evils of life, who can appreciate the rights of good-fellowship,
and fulfil the duties of loving attachment and is kind and affable,
sweet-spoken, and cheerful. I will treat you with affection, as far
as I can, and if you deal with me unkindly, I will not be unkind in
return. <i>If, like a parrot, thy food be sugar, I will devote my sweet
life for thy nourishment.</i> And you did not become the victim of a
rude, conceited, rash, and headstrong youth, who one moment gratifies
his lust, and the next has a fresh object; who every night shifts his
abode, and every day changes his mistress. Young men are lively and
handsome, but they keep good faith with nobody. <i>Expect not constancy
from nightingales, who will every moment serenade a fresh rose.</i>
Whereas my class of seniors regulate their lives by good breeding and
sense, and are not deluded by youthful ignorance.”</p>

<p><i>Court the society of a superior, and make much of the opportunity!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
for in the company of an equal thy good fortune must decline.</i></p>

<p>The old man spoke a great deal in this style, and thought that he had
caught her heart in his snare, and made sure of her as his prey, when
she suddenly drew a cold sigh from the bottom of a much-afflicted
bosom, and answered:</p>

<p>“All this speech which you have delivered has not, in the scale of my
judgment, the weight of that one sentence which I have heard of my
nurse, that it were better to plant a spear in a young maiden’s side
than to lay her by an old man in bed. Much contention and strife will
arise in that house where the wife shall get dissatisfied with her
husband.”</p>

<p><i>Unable to rise without the help of a staff, how can an old man stir
the staff of life?</i></p>

<p>In short, there being no prospect of concord, they agreed to separate.
After lapse of the period prescribed by the law, she united in wedlock
with a young man of an ill-tempered and sullen disposition, and in very
narrow circumstances, so that she endured much tyranny and violence,
penury and hardship. Yet she was thus offering up thanksgivings for the
Almighty’s goodness, and saying:</p>

<p>“Praised be God that I have escaped from such hell-torment, and secured
a blessing so permanent. With all this violence and impetuosity of
temper, I bear with his caprice, because he is handsome. It were better
for me to burn with him in hellfire than to dwell in paradise with the
other.”</p>

Permit me then to incur guilt before I meet my sentence. Let me kill
this Omer, my master, and I shall die contented. It is for thy sake
only I desire this</i>. The king, laughing at this new mode of clearing
his own justice, acquitted the wretch.</p>

<p>12. A king condemned an innocent man to death, who said, <i>O king, thy

<h4><i>THE SICK SCHOOLMASTER</i></h4>

<p class="p1">The boys of a certain school were tired of their teacher, as he was
very strict in the exaction of diligence; so they consulted together
for the best means of getting rid of him for a time. Said they, “Why
does he not fall ill, so that he may be obliged to be away from school,
and we be released from confinement and work? Alas! he stands as firm
as a rock.” One of them, who was wiser than the rest, suggested this
plan: “I shall go to the teacher, and ask him why he looks so pale,
saying, ‘May it turn out well! But your face has not its usual color.
Is it due to the weather, or to fever?’ This will create some alarm
in his mind. Then you, brother,” he continued, turning to another
boy, “must assist me by using similar words. When you come into the
schoolroom you must say to the teacher, ‘I hope, sir, you are well.’
This will tend to increase his apprehension, even though in a slight
degree; and you know that even slight doubts are often enough to drive
a man mad. Then a third, a fourth, and a fifth boy must one after
another express his sympathy in similar words, till at last, when
thirty boys successively have given expression to words of like nature,
the teacher’s apprehension will be confirmed.”</p>

<p>The boys praised his ingenuity, and wished each other success; and
they bound themselves by solemn promises not to shirk doing what was
expected of them. Then the first boy bade them take oaths of secrecy,
lest some telltale should let the matter out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span></p>

<p>Next morning the boys came to school in a cheerful mood, having
resolved on adopting the foregoing plan. They all stood outside the
schoolhouse, waiting for the arrival of the friend who had helped them
in the time of need&mdash;since it was he who had originated the plan: it
is the head that is the governor of the legs. The first boy arrived,
entered the schoolroom, and greeted the teacher with “I hope you are
well, sir, but the color of your face is very pale.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said the teacher; “there is nothing the matter with me. Go
and take your seat.” But inwardly he was somewhat apprehensive. Another
boy came in, and in similar words greeted the teacher, whose misgivings
were thereby somewhat increased. And so on, one boy after another
greeted him, till his worst apprehensions seemed to be confirmed, and
he was in great anxiety regarding the state of his health.</p>

<p>He got enraged at his wife. “Her love for me is waning,” he thought. “I
am in this bad state of health, and she did not even ask what was the
matter with me. She did not draw my attention to the color of my face.
Perhaps she is not unwilling that I should die.”</p>

<p>Full of such thoughts, he came to his home, followed by the boys, and
flung open the door. His wife exclaimed, “I hope nothing is the matter
with you! Why have you returned so soon?”</p>

<p>“Are you blind?” he answered. “Look at the color of my face, and at my
condition! Even strangers show sympathetic alarm about my health.”</p>

<p>“Well, I see nothing wrong,” said the wife. “You must be laboring under
some senseless delusion.”</p>

<p>“Woman,” he rejoined impatiently, “you are most obstinate! Can you not
perceive the altered hue of my face and the shivering of my body? Go
and get my bed made, that I may lie down, for my head is dizzy.”</p>

<p>The bed was prepared, and the teacher lay down on it, giving vent
to sighs and groans. The boys he ordered to sit there and read the
lessons, which they did with much vexation. They said to themselves,
“We did so much to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span> free, and still we are in confinement. The
foundation was not well laid; we are bad architects. Some other plan
must now be adopted, so that we may be rid of this annoyance.”</p>

<p>The clever boy who had instigated the first plot advised the others
to read their lessons very loudly; and when they did so, he said, in
a tone to be overheard by the teacher, “Boys, your voices disturb our
teacher. Loud voices will only increase his headache. Is it proper that
he should be made to suffer pain for the sake of the trifling fees he
gets from us?”</p>

<p>The teacher said, “He is right. Boys, you may go. My headache has
increased. Be off with you!” And the boys scampered away home as
eagerly as birds fly toward a spot where they see grain.</p>

<p>The mothers of the boys, on seeing them return, got angry, and thus
challenged them, “This is the time for you to learn writing, and you
are engaged in play. This is the time for acquiring knowledge, and you
fly from your books and your teacher.”</p>

<p>The boys urged that it was no fault of theirs, and that they were in no
way to blame, for, by the decree of fate, their teacher had become very
ill.</p>

<p>The mothers, disbelieving, said, “This is all deceit and falsehood. You
would not scruple to tell a hundred lies to get a little quantity of
buttermilk. To-morrow morning we shall go to the teacher’s house, and
shall ascertain what truth there is in your assertions.”</p>

<p>So the next morning the mothers went to visit the teacher, whom they
found lying in bed like a very sick person. He had perspired freely,
owing to his having covered himself with blankets. His head was
bandaged, and his face was covered with a kerchief. He was groaning in
a feeble voice.</p>

<p>The ladies expressed their sympathy, hoped his headache was getting
less, and swore by his soul that they had been unaware until quite
lately that he was so ill.</p>

<p>“I, too,” said the teacher, “was unaware of my illness. It was through
those little bastards that I learned of it.”</p>

<h4><i>THE INVALID AND HIS DEAF VISITOR</i></h4>

<p class="p1">A deaf man was informed that an neighbor of his was ill, so he resolved
upon going to see him. “But,” said he to himself, “owing to my deafness
I shall not be able to catch the words of the sick man, whose voice
must be very feeble at this time. However, go I must. When I see his
lips moving I shall be able to make a reasonably good conjecture of
what he is saying. When I ask him, ‘How are you, oh, my afflicted
friend?’ he will probably reply, ‘I am well,’ or ‘I am better.’ I shall
then say, ‘Thanks be to God! Tell me, what have you taken for food?’
He will probably mention some liquid food or gruel. I shall then wish
that the food may agree with him, and shall ask him the name of the
physician under whose treatment he is. On his naming the man, I shall
say, ‘He is a skilful leech. Since it is he who is attending upon you,
you will soon be well. I have had experience of him. Wherever he goes,
his patients very soon recover.”</p>

<p>So the deaf man, having prepared himself for the visit, went to the
invalid’s bedside, and sat down near the pillow. Then, rubbing his
hands together with assumed cheerfulness, he inquired, “How are you?”
“I am dying,” replied the patient. “Thanks be to God!” rejoined the
deaf man.</p>

<p>The sick man was troubled in his heart, and said to himself, “What kind
of thanksgiving is this? Surely he must be an enemy of mine!”&mdash;little
thinking that his visitor’s remark was but the result of wrong
conjecture.</p>

<p>“What have you been eating?” was the next question; to which the reply
was, “Poison!” “May it agree with you,” was the wish expressed by the
deaf man which only increased the other’s vexation.</p>

<p>“And pray, who is your physician?” again asked the visitor, “Azrael,
the Angel of Death. And now, be-gone with you!” growled the invalid.
“Oh, is he?” pursued the deaf man. “Then you ought to rejoice, for he
is a man of auspicious footsteps. I saw him only just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span> now, and asked
him to devote to you his best possible attention.”</p>

<p>With these words he bade the sick man good-by, and withdrew, rejoicing
that he had satisfactorily performed a neighborly duty. Meanwhile,
the other man was angrily muttering to himself, “This fellow is an
implacable foe of mine. I did not know his heart was so full of
malignity.”</p>

<p><i>Physician.</i> The weakness of the brain is due to old age.</p>

<p><i>Old Man.</i> Dark spots are floating before my eyes.</p>

<p><i>Physician.</i> That, too, comes from old age, oh, venerable sheikh!</p>

<p><i>Old Man.</i> My back aches very much.</p>

<p><i>Physician.</i> The result of old age, oh, lean sheikh!</p>

<p><i>Old Man.</i> No food that I take agrees with me.</p>

<p><i>Physician.</i> The failure of the digestive organs is also due to
old age.</p>

<p><i>Old Man.</i> I am afflicted with hard breathing.</p>

<p><i>Physician.</i> Yes, the breathing ought to be affected in that
manner. When old age comes, it brings a hundred complaints in its train.</p>

<p><i>Old Man.</i> My legs are getting feeble, and I am unable to walk
much.</p>

<p><i>Physician.</i> It is nothing but old age which obliges you to sit in
a corner.</p>

<p><i>Old Man.</i> My back has become bent like a bow.</p>

<p><i>Physician.</i> This trouble is merely the consequence of old age.</p>

<p><i>Old Man.</i> My eyesight is quite dim, oh, sage physician!</p>

<p><i>Physician.</i> Nothing but old age, oh, wise man!</p>

<p><i>Old Man.</i> Oh, you idiot, always harping on the same theme! Is
this all you know of the science of medicine? Fool, does not your
reason tell you that God has assigned a remedy to every ailment? You
are a stupid ass, and with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span> your paltry stock of learning are still
fumbling in the mire!</p>

<p><i>Physician.</i> Oh, you dotard past sixty, know, then, that even this
rage and fury is due to old age!</p>

<h4><i>DIVING FOR AN EGG&mdash;ANECDOTE</i></h4>

<p class="p1">The Emperor Akbar was one day sitting with his attendants in the
garden of the palace, close to a large cistern full of water. At the
suggestion of a courtier, the emperor commanded some of the men present
to procure an egg each, and to place it in the cistern in such a manner
that it could easily be found when searched for.</p>

<p>Soon after the order had been obeyed, the Mollah Do-pyazah came to this
spot. Akbar then turned to his attendants, saying he had dreamed the
night before that there were eggs in the cistern, and that all who were
his faithful servants had dived in, and brought out an egg. Whereupon
the attendants one by one dived into the water, each one issuing forth
with an egg in his hand. Do-pyazah, not disposed himself to enter the
water, the emperor asked why he alone held aloof. The mollah, thus
pressed, divested himself of his outer garments and plunged in.</p>

<p>He searched for a long time, but could not find a single egg. At length
he emerged from the cistern, and, moving his arms in the manner of a
cock flapping his wings, he cried aloud, “Cock-a-doodle-doo!”</p>

<p>“What,” asked Akbar, “is the meaning of this?”</p>

<p>“Your Majesty,” came the reply, “those who brought you the eggs were
hens, but I am a cock, and you must not expect an egg from me.”</p>

<p>At which Akbar laughed heartily, and had Do-pyazah well rewarded.</p>

<p>The Chinese are more noted for their wit that is wisdom, than for their
humor.</p>

<p>Confucius, doubtless the greatest of their philosophers, born 551
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, left many sayings which became proverbs, yet which
embodied only the elementary morality of all ages and races.</p>

<p>These are some of the sayings from <i>The Analects of Confucius</i>.</p>

<p>“While a man’s father is alive, look at the bent of his will; when his
father is dead, look at his conduct.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span></p>

<p>“An accomplished scholar is not a cooking-pot.”</p>

<p>“When good order prevailed in his country, Ning Wu acted the part of
a wise man; when his country was in disorder, he acted the part of a
fool. Others may equal his wisdom, but they cannot equal his folly.”</p>

<p>“How can one know about death, when one does not understand life?”</p>

<p>“Four horses cannot overtake the tongue.”</p>

<p>“If you were not covetous, you could not even bribe a man to steal from
you.”</p>

<p>“When their betters love the <i>Rules</i> [<i>of Propriety</i>], then
the folk are easy tools.”</p>

<p>“Why use an ox-knife to kill a hen?”</p>

<p>“There are two classes that never change: the supremely wise and the
profoundly stupid.”</p>

<p>“If a man is disliked at forty, he always will be.”</p>

<p>“When driving with a woman, hold the reins in one hand and keep the
other behind your back.”</p>

<p>Chwang Tze, another ancient, wrote much of life, death and immortality,
but showed little sense of humor therein.</p>

<p>One of his anecdotes, in lighter vein, follows.</p>


<h4><i>THE PLEASURE OF FISHES&mdash;ANECDOTE</i></h4>

<p class="p1">Chwang Tze and a friend had strolled on to a bridge over the Hao, when
the former observed, “Look how the minnows are darting about! That is
the pleasure of fishes.”</p>

<p>“Not being a fish yourself,” objected the friend, “how can you possibly
know in what the pleasure of fishes consists?”</p>

<p>“And you not being I,” retorted Chwang Tze, “how can you know that I do
not know?”</p>

<p>To which the friend replied, “If I, not being you, cannot know what you
know, it follows that you, not being a fish, cannot know in what the
pleasure of fishes consists.”</p>

<p>“Let us go back,” rejoined Chwang Tze, “to your original question. You
ask me how I know in what the pleasure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span> of fishes consists. Well, I
know that I am enjoying myself over the Hao, and from this I infer that
the fishes are enjoying themselves in it.”&mdash;<i>Autumn Floods.</i></p>

<h4><i>A STANZA FOR A TOBACCO-POUCH</i></h4>

<p class="smcap p1 p-left">Dear Friend:</p>

<p>I have received your letter of congratulation, and am much obliged.
At the end of the letter, however, you mention that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span> you have a
tobacco-pouch for me, which will be forwarded upon the receipt of
a stanza. But such an exchange would seem to establish a curious
precedent. If for a tobacco pouch you expect in return a stanza, for
a hat or a pair of boots you would demand a whole poem; while your
brother might bestow a cloak or coat upon me, and believe himself
entitled to an epic. At this rate, dear friend, your congratulations
would become rather costly to me.</p>

<p>Let me instruct you, on the other hand, that a man once gave a thousand
yards of silk for a phrase, and another man a beautiful girl for a
stanza&mdash;which makes your tobacco-pouch look like a slight inducement,
does it not?</p>

<p>Mencius forbids the taking advantage of people on the ground of one’s
rank or merits. How much worse, therefore, to do so by virtue of a mere
tobacco-pouch! Elegant as a tobacco-pouch may be, it is only the work
of a sempstress; but my poetry, poor as it may be, is the work of my
brain. The exchange would evidently be complimentary to the sempstress,
and the reverse to me.</p>

<p>Now, if you had taken needle and thread and made the pouch
yourself&mdash;ah, then what a difference! Then, indeed, a dozen stanzas
would not have been too great a return. But it would hardly be proper
to ask a famous warrior like yourself to lay down sword and shield for
needle and thread. Nor, dear friend, am I likely to get the pouch at
all, if you take offense at these little jokes of mine. What I advise
you to do is, to bear with me patiently, send the tobacco-pouch, and
wait for the stanza until it comes.</p>

<p class="r2 p-min">&mdash;<i>Letters.</i></p>


<h4><i>RECIPES</i></h4>

<p class="p1">Birds’ nests and water-slugs have no particular flavor of their own,
and are therefore not worth eating.</p>

<p>The best cook cannot prepare artistically more than five or six
different dishes in one day. A host of mine once had forty courses
served at a meal, and as soon as I got home I called for a bowl of rice
to still my hunger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span></p>

<p>In order to enjoy the pleasures of the palate to the fullest degree,
you must be sober. If you are drunk, you cannot tell one flavor from
another.</p>

<p>The ingredients of a dish should always harmonize with one
another&mdash;like two people in marriage.</p>

<p>Some cooks use the flesh of chickens and pigs for one soup, and as
chickens and pigs have souls, they will hold those cooks to account, in
the next world, for their treatment of them in this.</p>

<p>Bamboo-shoots ought never to be cut with a knife which has just been
used on onions.</p>

<p>While cooking, do not allow ashes from your pipe, perspiration from
your face, soot from the fuel, or beetles from the ceiling to drop
into the saucepan: the guests would be likely to pass the dish
by.&mdash;<i>Cookery Book</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following proverbs are generally attributed to the Chinese, some of
them being the wisdom of Confucius.</p>


<h4><i>PROVERBS</i></h4>

<p class="p1">An avaricious man, who can never get enough, is like a snake trying to
swallow an elephant.</p>

<p>To draw the picture of a tiger, and make a dog out of it, is to imitate
a masterpiece and spoil it.</p>

<p>Human pleasures are like the flittings of sparrows.</p>

<p>A narrow-minded man resembles a frog in a well.</p>

<p>Do not pull up your stockings in a melon-patch, or straighten your hat
in a peach orchard; any one seeing you may think you are stealing.</p>

<p>To talk much and arrive nowhere is the same as climbing a tree to catch
a fish.</p>

<p>One thread does not make a rope.</p>

<p>The tiger does not walk with the hind.</p>

<p>You can neither buy wood in the forest nor fish by the lake.</p>

<p>If a blind man leads another blind man, they will both fall into a
hole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span></p>

<p>No maker of idols worships the gods; he knows their composition too
well.</p>

<p>A man with a purple nose may be very temperate in drink, only no one
will believe it.</p>

<p>Money makes the blind man see.</p>

<p>We admire our own writings, but other men’s wives.</p>

<p>If you are afraid of being found out, leave it alone.</p>

<p>Bend your neck if the eaves are low.</p>

<p>It’s not the wine that makes a man drunk; it’s the man himself.</p>

<p>A whisper on earth sounds like thunder in heaven.</p>

<p>To get a favor granted is harder than to kill a tiger.</p>

<p>Sweep the snow from your own door.</p>

<p>If there were no error there could be no truth.</p>

<p>A needle never pricks with both ends.</p>

<p>Don’t put two saddles on one horse.</p>

<p>Trust nature rather than a bad doctor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Japanese offer little that can be quoted. Their comedies are long
and not very funny, their wit is heavy and bitterly satirical.</p>

<p>One specimen is given from <i>The Land of Dreams</i> by Kiokutei Bakin.</p>


<h4><i>ON CLOTHES AND COMFORTS</i></h4>

<p class="p1">However much money you have, you will not keep it long; it will leave
you, just like a traveler who has stayed overnight at an inn. The only
substantial things in life are food and drink. Any little house you
can just crawl into is large enough. The only difference between an
emperor’s palace and a straw hut is in their size and their situation,
one being in town and the other in the country. A single room, with
a mat long enough for you to stretch out your whole body, is quite
sufficient lodging. As for the clothes which you dress your carcass in,
the richest brocades and the commonest sackcloth differ only in being
clean or dirty. After you are dead, no one can tell, from looking at
your naked body,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span> what sort of clothes you wore while alive. If these
facts were to become recognized, our clothes would be patched with any
sort of material or color. Now, however, a man will buy new, expensive
garments which he does not really want, owe the money for them, strut
about in these borrowed plumes, and finally pawn them.</p>

<p class="r2 p-min">&mdash;<i>The Land of Dreams.</i></p>


<h4><i>COLLECTIONS</i></h4>

<p class="p1">Apologues and stories, now common to all the world, had their origin
in remote antiquity. Eastern narratives were for the most part brought
to Europe orally, but some were later translated from the Oriental
writings.</p>

<p>Since at first, Religion and Learning went hand in hand, these stories
were of a moral and instructive nature. Their wit was the wit of
wisdom, the pithiness of graphic representation of truth.</p>

<p>But with the development of the wit of amusement, the rise of ribald
laughter and the supremacy of priests and monks, the stories took on a
mirthful character which may or may not have added to their efficacy as
cautionary teachings.</p>

<p>Humor, then, as now, was founded on the feeling of superiority which
comes from knowledge. The stories were invariably of the discomfiture
of some foolish person, and thereby, either definitely or tacitly
advised against that particular foolishness.</p>

<p>Narrative fiction was entirely in parables or apologues, the latter
term having come to be used exclusively for the tales in which animals
are invested with human traits.</p>

<p>Fables, also, is a term usually restricted to moral lessons taught by
anecdotes of beasts in human conditions.</p>

<p>As usual in the matter of legendary literature various countries
contend for the honor of producing the first fables.</p>

<p>The bestowal of the palm rests between the Hindus and the Hebrews, but
the decision may never be made.</p>

<p>A plausible assumption for the necessity of fables lies in the fact
that it was not the part of wisdom openly to administer reproof or
advice to the Asiatic potentates, wherefore it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span> done by the device
of speaking through the mouths of the fictitious characters.</p>

<p>And, through the ages, this plan has been found to work with
intractables of less celebrity.</p>

<p>But the question of the origin of these stories is outside our
Outline,&mdash;we may merely state that before, during and after the
Crusades, the flood of stories and tales from the Orient into Europe
was continuous.</p>

<p>Which accounts for the fact that among the oldest stories of the
various countries, duplicates are always found, and the ancient jests
of the Far East have raised and will raise appreciative laughter
as they are translated into all European tongues, including the
Scandinavian.</p>

<p>As religion gave rise to laughter, so religion was the medium for
disseminating mirth.</p>

<p>The preachers of the mediæval ages used many amusing stories in their
sermons and the monks often preserved these, with additions of their
own, in enduring literature.</p>

<p>But literature then was not in the form of circulating libraries, so
the tales traveled from mouth to mouth, gaining sometimes in interest
and sometimes losing charm or worth.</p>

<p>Perhaps about the tenth century translations began to be grouped into
collections, in Europe, and among the first was the Greek version of
the Fables of Pilpay. Soon after came the <i>Book of Sindibad</i>,
which would seem to be the original form of the story of Scheherazade.</p>

<p>But in most cases the monks were the go-between.</p>

<p>Their zeal and indefatigability produced masses of material, primarily
designed for the use of preachers, but easily adopted by the laymen.</p>

<p>The <i>Sermones</i> of Jacques de Vitry, Crusader and prelate, and
the <i>Liber de Donis</i> of Etienne de Bourbon are both remarkable
collections that predated and later gave material to the Gesta
Romanorum.</p>

<p>As an instance of the ubiquity of stories, it may be mentioned here
that in both the books above noticed, occurs the old tale of the
husband who had two wives, the younger one of whom plucked out all
his gray-white hairs, the older one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span> plucked out all his black hairs,
leaving the poor chap entirely bald. This story is also in the Talmud,
in Chinese Jestbooks and in innumerable others.</p>

<p>So with many of the ancient tales. They come down through the Fabliaux,
Gesta Romanorum, the Heptameron, the Decameron and on to our own dinner
tables, where many of the “latest” are merely rehashed witticisms of
the ancient monks and priests.</p>

<p>Nor are the stories fastened on to celebrities often authentic. Many of
Sydney Smith’s witticisms hark back to the Eastern Tales, most of Joe
Miller’s jests have similar paternity.</p>

<p>Hierocles made a famous collection of old stories translated into
Greek. Others followed rapidly even before the invention of printing.</p>

<p>After that achievement, collections of stories flooded the book mart
even as they do today.</p>

<p>Selections from various collections follow.</p>

<p>Perhaps the oldest collection of tales in the world is that known
as the <i>Fables of Bidpai or Pilpay</i>. Both author and date of
production are unknown, but tradition tells us that they were written
in Sanscrit and were the work of one Vishnu Sarma, who wrote them for
the advice and edification of certain princes. The book is enormously
long and though not of humorous intent shows much of the native wit of
the country.</p>

<span class="subhed"><i>THE GREEDY AND AMBITIOUS CAT</i></span></h4>

<p class="p1">There was formerly an old Woman in a village, extremely thin,
half-starved, and meager. She lived in a little cottage as dark and
gloomy as a fool’s heart, and withal as close shut up as a miser’s
hand. This miserable creature had for the companion of her wretched
retirements a Cat meager and lean as herself; the poor creature never
saw bread, nor beheld the face of a stranger, and was forced to be
contented with only smelling the mice in their holes, or seeing the
prints of their feet in the dust. If by some extraordinary lucky chance
this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span> miserable animal happened to catch a mouse, she was like a beggar
that discovers a treasure; her visage and her eyes were inflamed
with joy, and that booty served her for a whole week; and out of the
excess of her admiration, and distrust of her own happiness, she would
cry out to herself, “Heavens! Is this a dream, or is it real?” One
day, however, ready to die for hunger, she got upon the ridge of her
enchanted castle, which had long been the mansion of famine for cats,
and spied from thence another Cat, that was stalking upon a neighbour’s
wall like a Lion, walking along as if she had been counting her steps,
and so fat that she could hardly go. The old Woman’s Cat, astonished to
see a creature of her own species so plump and so large, with a loud
voice, cries out to her pursy neighbour, “In the name of pity, speak to
me, thou happiest of the Cat kind! why, you look as if you came from
one of the Khan of Kathai’s feasts; I conjure ye, to tell me how, or
in what region it is that you get your skin so well stuffed?” “Where?”
replied the fat one; “why, where should one feed well but at a King’s
table? I go to the house,” continued she, “every day about dinner-time,
and there I lay my paws upon some delicious morsel or other, which
serves me till the next, and then leave enough for an army of mice,
which under me live in peace and tranquillity; for why should I commit
murder for a piece of tough and skinny mouse flesh, when I can live on
venison at a much easier rate?” The lean Cat, on this, eagerly inquired
the way to this house of plenty, and entreated her plump neighbour to
carry her one day along with her. “Most willingly,” said the fat Puss;
“for thou seest I am naturally charitable, and thou art so lean that
I heartily pity thy condition.” On this promise they parted; and the
lean Cat returned to the old Woman’s chamber, where she told her dame
the story of what had befallen her. The old Woman prudently endeavoured
to dissuade her Cat from prosecuting her design, admonishing her
withal to have a care of being deceived. “For, believe me,” said she,
“the desires of the ambitious are never to be satiated, but when
their mouths are stuffed with the dirt of their graves. Sobriety and
temperance are the only things that truly enrich people. I must tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
thee, poor silly Cat, that they who travel to satisfy their ambition,
have no knowledge of the good things they possess, nor are they truly
thankful to Heaven for what they enjoy, who are not contented with
their fortune.”</p>

<p>The poor starved Cat, however, had conceived so fair an idea of
the King’s table, that the old Woman’s good morals and judicious
remonstrances entered in at one ear and went out at the other; in
short, she departed the next day with the fat Puss to go to the King’s
house; but alas! before she got thither, her destiny had laid a snare
for her. For being a house of good cheer, it was so haunted with cats,
that the servants had, just at this time, orders to kill all the cats
that came near it, by reason of a great robbery committed the night
before in the King’s larder by several grimalkins. The old Woman’s Cat,
however, pushed on by hunger, entered the house, and no sooner saw a
dish of meat unobserved by the cooks, but she made a seizure of it,
and was doing what for many years she had not done before, that is,
heartily filling her belly; but as she was enjoying herself under the
dresser-board, and feeding heartily upon her stolen morsels, one of the
testy officers of the kitchen, missing his breakfast, and seeing where
the poor Cat was solacing herself with it, threw his knife at her with
such an unlucky hand, that he stuck her full in the breast. However, as
it has been the providence of Nature to give his creature nine lives
instead of one, poor Puss made a shift to crawl away, after she had for
some time shammed dead: but, in her flight, observing the blood come
streaming from her wound; “Well,” said she, “let me but escape this
accident, and if ever I quit my old hold and my own mice for all the
rarities in the King’s kitchen, may I lose all my nine lives at once.”</p>


<h4><i>A RAVEN, A FOX, AND A SERPENT</i></h4>

<p class="p1">A Raven had once built her nest for many seasons together in a
convenient cleft of a mountain, but however pleasing the place was to
her, she had always reason enough to resolve to lay there no more; for
every time she hatched, a Serpent came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span> and devoured her young ones.
The Raven complaining to a Fox that was one of her friends, said to
him, “Pray tell me, what would you advise me to do to be rid of this
Serpent?” “What do you think to do?” answered the Fox. “Why, my present
intent is,” replied the Raven, “to go and peck out his eyes when he
is asleep, that so he may no longer find the way to my nest.” The Fox
disapproved this design, and told the Raven, that it became a prudent
person to manage his revenge in such a manner, that no mischief might
befall himself in taking it: “Never run yourself,” says he, “into the
misfortune that once befell the Crane, of which I will tell you the
Fable.”</p>


<h4><i>THE CRANE AND THE CRAY-FISH</i></h4>

<p class="p1">A Crane had once settled her habitation by the side of a broad and deep
lake, and lived upon such fish as she could catch in it; these she got
in plenty enough for many years; but at length being become old and
feeble, she could fish no longer. In this afflicting circumstance she
began to reflect, with sorrow, on the carelessness of her past years;
“I did ill,” said she to herself, “in not making in my youth necessary
provision to support me in my old age; but, as it is, I must now make
the best of a bad market, and use cunning to get a livelihood as I
can”: with this resolution she placed herself by the waterside, and
began to sigh and look mighty melancholy. A Cray-fish, perceiving her
at a distance, accosted her, and asked her why she appeared so sad?
“Alas,” said she, “how can I otherwise choose but grieve, seeing my
daily nourishment is like to be taken from me? for I just now heard
this talk between two fishermen passing this way: said the one to the
other, Here is great store of fish, what think you of clearing this
pond? to whom his companion answered, no; there is more in such a lake:
let us go thither first, and then come hither the day afterwards. This
they will certainly perform; and then,” added the Crane, “I must soon
prepare for death.”</p>

<p>The Cray-fish, on this, went to the fish, and told them what she had
heard: upon which the poor fish, in great perplexity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span> swam immediately
to the Crane, and addressing themselves to her, told her what they had
heard, and added, “We are now in so great a consternation, that we are
come to desire your protection. Though you are our enemy, yet the wise
tell us, that they who make their enemy their sanctuary, may be assured
of being well received: you know full well that we are your daily food;
and if we are destroyed, you, who are now too old to travel in search
of food, must also perish; we pray you, therefore, for your own sake,
as well as ours, to consider, and tell us what you think is the best
course for us to take.” To which the Crane replied, “That which you
acquaint me with, I heard myself from the mouths of the fishermen; we
have no power sufficient to withstand them; nor do I know any other way
to secure you, but this: it will be many months before they can clear
the other pond they are to go about first: and, in the mean time, I
can at times, and as my strength will permit me, remove you one after
another into a little pond here hard by, where there is very good
water, and where the fishermen can never catch you, by reason of the
extraordinary depth.” The fish approved this counsel, and desired the
Crane to carry them one by one into this pond. Nor did she fail to fish
up three or four every morning, but she carried them no farther than
to the top of a small hill, where she eat them: and thus she feasted
herself for a while.</p>

<p>But one day, the Cray-fish, having a desire to see this delicate pond,
made known her curiosity to the Crane, who, bethinking herself that
the Cray-fish was her most mortal enemy, resolved to get rid of her at
once, and murder her as she had done the rest; with this design she
flung the Cray-fish upon her neck, and flew towards the hill. But when
they came near the place, the Cray-fish, spying at a distance the small
bones of her slaughtered companions, mistrusted the Crane’s intention,
and laying hold of a fair opportunity, got her neck in her claw, and
grasped it so hard, that she fairly saved herself, and strangled the
Crane.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“This example,” says the Fox, “shows you, that crafty tricking people
often become victims to their own cunning.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span> The Raven, returning
thanks to the Fox for his good advice, said, “I shall not by any means
neglect your wholesome instructions; but what shall I do?” “Why,”
replied the Fox, “you must snatch up something that belongs to some
stout man or other, and let him see what you do, to the end he may
follow you. Which that he may easily do, do you fly slowly; and when
you are just over the Serpent’s hole, let fall the thing that you hold
in your beak or talons whatever it be, for then the person that follows
you, seeing the Serpent come forth, will not fail to knock him on the
head.” The Raven did as the Fox advised him, and by that means was
delivered from the Serpent.</p>


<h4><i>THE MERCHANT AND HIS FRIEND</i></h4>

<p class="p1">A Certain Merchant, said Kalila, pursuing her discourse, had once a
great desire to make a long journey. Now in regard that he was not
very wealthy, it is requisite, said he to himself, that before my
departure I should leave some part of my estate in the city, to the
end that if I meet with ill luck in my travels, I may have wherewithal
to keep me at my return. To this purpose he delivered a great number
of bars of iron, which were a principal part of his wealth, in trust
to one of his friends, desiring him to keep them during his absence;
and then taking his leave, away he went. Some time after, having had
but ill luck in his travels, he returned home; and the first thing he
did was to go to his Friend, and demand his iron: but his Friend, who
owed several sums of money, having sold the iron to pay his own debts,
made him this answer: “Truly friend,” said he, “I put your iron into
a room that was close locked, imagining it would have been there as
secure as my own gold; but an accident has happened which nobody could
have suspected, for there was a rat in the room eat it all up.” The
Merchant, pretending ignorance, replied, “It is a terrible misfortune
to me indeed; but I know of old that rats love iron extremely; I have
suffered by them many times before in the same manner, and therefore
can the better bear my present affliction.” This answer extremely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
pleased the Friend, who was glad to hear the Merchant so well inclined
to believe that the rats had eaten his iron; and to remove all
suspicions, desired him to dine with him the next day. The Merchant
promised he would, but in the mean time he met in the middle of the
city one of his Friend’s children; the child he carried home, and
locked up in a room. The next day he went to his Friend, who seemed to
be in great affliction, which he asked him the cause of, as if he had
been perfectly ignorant of what had happened. “Oh, my dear friend,”
answered the other, “I beg you to excuse me, if you do not see me so
cheerful as otherwise I would be; I have lost one of my children; I
have had him cried by sound of trumpet, but I know not what is become
of him.” “Oh!” replied the Merchant, “I am grieved to hear this; for
yesterday in the evening, as I parted from hence, I saw an owl in the
air with a child in his claws; but whether it were yours I cannot
tell.” “Why, you most foolish and absurd creature!” replied the Friend,
“are you not ashamed to tell such an egregious lie? An owl, that weighs
at most not above two or three pounds, can he carry a boy that weighs
above fifty?” “Why,” replied the merchant, “do you make such a wonder
at that? as if in a country where one rat can eat an hundred ton weight
of iron, it were such a wonder for an owl to carry a child that weighs
not above fifty pounds in all.” The Friend, upon this, found that the
Merchant was no such fool as he took him to be, begged his pardon for
the cheat which he designed to have put upon him, restored him the
value of his iron, and so had his son again.</p>

<h4><i>THE MAID, THE MONKEY, AND THE MENDICANT</i></h4>

<p class="p1">On the banks of the Ganges there was once a city named Makandi. And in
a temple, not far from the river, there lived a religious mendicant
with a large number of disciples. He was a great rogue, but to impress
the minds of the credulous people of the neighbourhood, he affected
to be perfectly indifferent to all worldly affairs, and even went so
far as to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span> taken a vow of perpetual silence. Now, in this city
there resided a wealthy merchant, who believed in the mendicant,
and was one of his devoted followers. The merchant had a beautiful
daughter, who had just come of age, and who, entertaining a tender
feeling for a handsome prince who lived in the neighbourhood, had
begun to communicate with him by means of a confidential servant.
One day the mendicant came on a begging excursion to the house of
the merchant, and his daughter, beautifully dressed, came out with a
silver cup in her hand to give him alms. The beggar as soon as he saw
her forgot his vow of perpetual silence, and exclaimed, “Oh! what a
sight!” but immediately afterwards he was ashamed of the words which
he had uttered, and hastened home to the temple. The merchant, who
had heard these words, thought that there was something unusual in
them, and followed the mendicant to his abode. The latter, on seeing
him, said with tears in his eyes, “Friend, I know that you are greatly
devoted to me, and I grieve to say that a great misfortune will come
upon you. The marks upon the body of your beautiful daughter foretell
the ruin of your family, and the loss of your wealth as soon as she
is married.” These words frightened the merchant almost out of his
wits, and he implored the hypocritical mendicant to tell him if there
were any means of averting the catastrophe. “There is one remedy,” he
replied, “but you will find it hard to practise. You must make a box
with holes in the lid, in the form of a boat, and having administered
a narcotic to your daughter, place her in it, and closing the box, put
it into the Ganges with a lamp burning on it. The waters of the river
will carry her to some distant country, where doubtless she will be
married, but her marriage there will not affect your fortune here.”
Pleased with this apparently disinterested advice, the silly merchant
returned home, and did as he was told. Fortunately, however, for
the girl, her confidential servant heard what was going to be done,
and immediately informed the young prince, the girl’s lover, of the
intentions of her father. At night he accordingly watched by the river,
and as soon as the box was left there he got hold of it, and brought
it home, and taking the sleeping girl out, put into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span> her place a large
and ferocious monkey, and, having closed the lid, sent it back to the
river upon whose broad stream it was floated once more. In the meantime
the mendicant was enjoying golden dreams about the future. Thinking to
secure the girl for himself, he sent some of his disciples to the river
side, and told them to get hold of the box as it came floating down the
stream. He further enjoined them not to pay any attention to anything
they might hear inside the box, but to bring it directly to him as
soon as they found it. On the box being brought, he had it carried to
his cell, and then told his disciples to remain at a distance, and
not to disturb him, as he had to perform some religious ceremonies in
connection with it. The disciples then retired, and the mendicant began
to open the box with the most pleasing anticipations. But alas, the
retribution of sin is often too near. The ferocious monkey, exasperated
by his confinement, jumped out at once, and began to bite, scratch, and
tear the poor mendicant in every way. The latter bawled out as loud as
he could, but his disciples thinking that he was performing religious
ceremonies, or fighting with the devil, did not come to his assistance.
At last he succeeded in opening the door of his room, and got away with
the loss of his nose and an ear. The monkey also bolted through the
door, and disappeared into the jungle. The good people of Nakandi were
much amused with the incident, and drove the mendicant out of the town.
The merchant’s daughter was delighted to find herself with her lover,
while her father, covered with shame, consoled himself with the idea
that she had got a good husband.</p>


<h4><i>ABOUT A WOMAN’S PROMISE</i></h4>

<p class="p1">In the city of Madanpur there reigned a king, named Birbar. In the
same city there lived a trader, called Hermyadutt, who had a daughter,
by name Madansena. One day, in the season of spring, she went with
her female friends to a garden, and when there met a young man, named
Somdatt, the son of the merchant Dharmdatt. This young man fell
violently in love with her at first sight, and involuntarily went up
to her, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span> taking hold of her hand, began to say, “If thou wilt not
love me, I shall abandon my life on thy account.” The girl said, “You
must not do so, for in doing this you will commit a great sin.” Somdatt
replied, “Excessive love has pierced my heart. The fear of separation
has burnt up my body. From the pain all my memory and intellect are
lost, and at present, through my excess of love, I have no regard
for virtue or sin. If you will give me a promise, I shall hope to
live.” Madansena said, “On the fifth day from this I am going to be
married, then I shall first meet you, and after that I shall go with my
husband.” Having given this promise, and affirming it by oath, she went
home.</p>

<p>On the fifth day after this she was married, and her husband took her
to his house. After several days her sisters-in-law forcibly took her
to her husband at night, but she would have nothing to do with him;
and, when he wished to embrace her, she jerked him with her hand, and
told the story of her promise to the merchant’s son. Hearing this, her
husband said, “If thou truly wishest to go with him, then go.”</p>

<p>Having thus obtained her husband’s consent, she put on her best clothes
and jewels, and started for the merchant’s house. On her way she met
a thief, who asked her where she was going alone at that midnight
hour so adorned. She replied, “That she was going to meet her lover.”
On hearing this, the thief said, “Who is your protector here?” She
replied, “Kama, the god of love, with his weapons is my protector.”
She then told the whole story to the thief, and said, “Do not spoil my
attire. I promise you that, on my return, I will give you up all my
jewels.”</p>

<p>The thief let her go, and she proceeded to the place where Somdatt was
lying asleep. Awaking him suddenly, he arose bewildered, and asked her
who she was, and why she had come. She replied, “I am the daughter of
the merchant Hermyadutt. Do you not remember that you forcibly took my
hand in the garden, and insisted on my giving you my oath, and I swore,
at your bidding, that I would leave the man I was married to, and come
to you. I have come accordingly; do to me whatever thou pleasest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span></p>

<p>Somdatt asked her if she had told the story to her husband, and she
said that she had told him all, and that he had allowed her to come.
The youth said: “This affair is like jewels without apparel; or food
without clarified butter; or singing out of tune; all these things
are alike. In the same way, dirty garments take away beauty, bad food
saps the strength, a wicked wife takes away life, a bad son ruins the
family. What a woman does not do is of little moment, for she does not
give utterance to the thoughts of her mind; and what is at the tip of
her tongue she does not reveal, and what she does, she does not tell
of. God has created a woman in the world as a wonder.”</p>

<p>After uttering these words, the merchant’s son said: “I will have
nothing to do with the wife of a stranger.” Hearing this, she returned
homeward. On her way she met the thief, and told him the whole story.
He applauded her highly, and let her go, and she went to her husband
and related to him the whole circumstance. Her husband, however,
evinced no affection for her, but said, “The beauty of the cuckoo
consists in its note alone; the beauty of a woman consists in her
fidelity to her husband; the beauty of an ugly man is his knowledge;
the beauty of a devotee is his patient suffering.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having related so much, the sprite said, “O king! whose is the highest
merit of these three?” Vickram replied: “The thief’s merit is the
greatest.” “How,” asked the sprite? The king answered: “Seeing that her
heart was set on another man, the husband let her go; through fear of
the king, Somdatt let her alone; whereas there was no reason for the
thief leaving her unmolested; therefore the thief is superior.”</p>


<h4><i>OF A QUEER RELATIONSHIP</i></h4>

<p class="p1">There is a city in the south named Dhurumpoor, the king of which was
named Mahabal. Once upon a time another king of the same region led
an army against him, and invested his capital. After much fighting
Mahabal was defeated, and, taking his wife and daughter with him, he
fled by night into the jungle. After travelling several miles the day
broke,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span> and a village came in view. Leaving the queen and princess
seated beneath a tree, he himself went to the village to get something
to eat, and in the meantime a band of Bhils, or hill robbers, came and
surrounded him, and told him to throw down his arms.</p>

<p>The king, on hearing this, commenced discharging arrows at them, and
the Bhils did the same from their side. After fighting for some time,
an arrow struck the king’s forehead with such force that he reeled and
fell, and one of the Bhils came up and cut off his head. When the queen
and the princess saw that the king was dead, they went back into the
jungle weeping and beating their breasts. After going some distance
they became tired and sat down, and began to be troubled with anxiety.</p>

<p>Now, it happened that a king named Chandrasen, together with his
son, while pursuing game, came into that very jungle, and the king,
noticing the footprints of the two women, said to his son, “How have
the footprints of human feet come into this vast forest?” The prince
replied, “These are women’s footprints, a man’s foot is not so small.”
The king said, “Come let us look for them, and if we find them I
will give her whose foot is the largest to thee, and I will take the
other for myself.” Having entered into this mutual compact, they went
forward, and soon perceived the two women seated on the ground. They
were delighted at finding them, and seating them on their horses in the
manner agreed upon, they brought them home. The prince took possession
of the queen, as her feet were the largest, and the king took the
princess, and they were married accordingly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having related so much the sprite said, “Your majesty, what
relationship will there be between the children of these two?” On
hearing this, the king held his tongue through ignorance, being unable
to describe the relationship.</p>

<p>Hierocles’ collection of jests is mostly short anecdotes of pedants who
are shown up as simpletons or noodles.</p>

<p>This principle of humor which is, of course, the rock bottom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span> theory
of the feeling of superiority induced by the discomfiture of the other
man, often pins the jest on the pedant or scholar by way of emphasizing
the point.</p>

<p>Hierocles was an Alexandrian Neoplatonic philosopher who lived in the
Fifth Century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span></p>

of the Middle Ages, and in their existing form probably date about the

<p>From Bhartrihari, an Indian philosopher who flourished about the ninth
century, we select the following cynical paragraphs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I believed that one woman was devoted to me, but she is now attracted
by another man, and another man takes pleasure in her, while a second
woman interests herself in me. Curses on them both, and on the god of
love, and on the other woman, and on myself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The fundamentally ignorant man is easily led, and the wise man still
more easily; but not even the Almighty Himself can exercise any
influence on the smatterer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A man may tear the pearl from between the teeth of the crocodile; he
may steer his ship over the roughest seas; he may twine a serpent round
his brow like a laurel; but he cannot convince a foolish and stubborn
opponent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A man may squeeze oil from sand; he may slake his thirst from the well
in a mirage; he may even obtain possession of a hare’s horn; but he
cannot convince a foolish and stubborn opponent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A dog will eat with delight the most noisome and decaying bones, and
will pay no attention even if the ruler of the gods stands before
him&mdash;and in like manner a mean man takes no heed of the worthlessness
of his belongings.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Our nobility of birth may pass away; our virtues may fall into decay:
our moral character may perish as if thrown over a precipice: our
family may be burnt to ashes, and a thunderbolt may dash away our power
like an enemy: let us keep a firm grip on our money, for without this
the whole assembly of virtues are but as blades of glass.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Let a man be wealthy, and he shall be quite wise, learned in the sacred
writings and of good birth; virtuous, handsome and eloquent. Gold
attracts all the virtues to itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span></p>

<p>The same portion of the sky that forms a circle round the moon by night
also forms a circle round the sun by day How great is the labour of
both!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A sour heart; a face hardened with inward pride and a nature as
difficult to penetrate as the narrowest of mountain passes&mdash;these
things are known to be characteristic of women: their mind is known
by the wise to be as changeable as the drop of dew on the lotus leaf.
Faults develop in a woman as she grows up, exactly as poisonous
branches sprout from the creeper.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The beautiful features of a woman are praised by the poets&mdash;her breasts
are compared to pots of gold: her face to the shining moon, and her
hips to the forehead of an elephant: nevertheless the beauty of a woman
merits no praise.</p>

philosopher.</p>

<p>A learned man being annoyed while writing a letter to one of his
confidential friends, at the conduct of a person who, seated at his
side, glanced out of the corner of his eye at his writing, wrote: “Had
not a hireling thief been seated at my side and engaged in reading my
letter I should have written to thee all my secrets.” The man said:
“By God, my lord, I have neither read nor even looked at thy letter.”
“Fool!” exclaimed the other; “how then canst thou say what thou now
sayest?”</p>

<p>A mendicant once coming to beg something at the door of a house, the
master of it called out to him from the interior:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span> “Pray excuse me: the
women of the house are not here.” The beggar retorted: “I wish for a
morsel of bread, not to embrace the women of the house.”</p>

<p>A certain person made a claim of ten dirams on Júhí. The judge
enquired: “Hast thou any testimony to offer?” On the answer being in
the negative he continued: “Shall I put him on his oath?” “Of what
value is <i>his</i> oath?” said the man in reply. “O judge of the
Faithful,” then proposed Júhí in his turn, “there lives in my quarter
of the town an Imám, temperate, truthful and beneficent, send for him
and put him on his oath instead of me, that this man’s mind may be
easy.”</p>

<p>Jáhiz relates: “I never experienced so much shame as this event
occasioned me. One day a woman took my hand and led me to the shop of
a master metal founder, saying to him: ‘Be it thus formed.’ I being
puzzled to know what this conduct signified, questioned the master, who
in reply said: ‘She had ordered me to make her a figure in the form
of Satan. When I told her that I did not know in what semblance to
make it, she brought thee, as thou knowest, and said: ‘Make it in this
semblance.’”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The same learned man, too, gives us this relation: “As I was once
standing in the street, in conversation with a friend, a woman came and
standing opposite me, gazed in my face. When her staring had exceeded
all bounds, I said to my slave: ‘Go to that woman and ask her what she
seeks.’ The slave returning to me thus reported her answer: ‘I wished
to inflict some punishment on my eyes which had committed a great
fault, and could find none more severe for them than the sight of thy
ugly face.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span></p>

<p>A person who perceived an ugly man asking pardon for his sins, and
praying for deliverance from the fire of hell, said to him: “Wherefore,
O friend, with such a countenance as thou hast, would’st thou cheat
hell, and give such a face reluctantly to the fire?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An assembly of people being seated together, and engaged in discussing
the merits and defects of men, one of them observed: “Whoever has not
two seeing eyes is but half a man; and whoever has not in his house a
beautiful bride is but half a man; finally he who cannot swim in the
sea is but half a man.” A blind man in the company who had no wife, and
could not swim, called out to him: “O my dear friend, thou hast laid
down an extraordinary principle, and cast me so far out of the circle
of manhood, that still half a man is required before I can take the
name of one who is no man.”</p>

<p>A Beduin having lost a camel, made an oath that when he found it he

his oath, he tied a cat to its neck, and called out: “Who will buy
the camel for one diram and the cat for a hundred dirams; but both
together, as I will not part them.” “How cheap,” said a person who had
arrived there, “would be this camel, had it not this collar attached to
its neck!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A Beduin who had lost a camel, proclaimed: “Whoever brings me my camel
shall have two camels as a reward.” “Out, man!” said they to him; “what
kind of business is this? Is the whole ass load of less value than
a small additional bundle laid upon it?” “You have this excuse for
your words,” replied he, “that you have never tasted the pleasure of
finding, and the sweetness of recovering what has been lost.”</p>

<p>A Khalíf was partaking of food with an Arab from the desert. During

exclaimed: “It is impossible to eat at the table of one who looks so at

said the man, “I am in want of the deposit which I left.” “Be seated
a moment,” replied the other, “until I have finished the lesson.” The
weaver sat down, but the lesson lasted a long time and he was pressed
for time. Now that learned man had a habit when giving lessons, of
wagging his head, and the weaver seeing this, and fancying that to
give a lesson was merely to wag the head, said: “Rise up, O Professor,
and make me thy deputy till thy return: let me wag my head in place

<p>From a collection called <i>The Pleasantries of Cogia Nasr Eddin
Effendi</i>, the typical noodle of the Turks.</p>

<p>Cogia Effendi one day went into a garden, pulled up some carrots and
turnips and other kinds of vegetables, which he found, putting some
into a sack and some into his bosom; suddenly the gardener coming up,
laid hold of him, and said, “What are you seeking here?” The Cogia,
being in great consternation, not finding any other reply, answered,
“For some days past a great wind has been blowing, and that wind blew
me hither.” “But who pulled up these vegetables,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span> said the gardener?
“As the wind blew very violently,” replied the Cogia, “it cast me here
and there, and whatever I laid hold of in the hope of saving myself
remained in my hands.” “Ah,” said the gardener, “but who filled the
sack with them?” “Well,” said the Cogia, “that is the very question I
was about to ask myself when you came up.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One day Cogia Nasr Eddin Effendi said, “O Mussulmen, give thanks to God
Most High that He did not give the camel wings; for, had He given them,
they would have perched upon your houses and chimneys, and have caused
them to tumble upon your heads.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One day the, Cogia saw a great many ducks playing on the top of a
fountain. The Cogia, running towards them, said, “I’ll catch you”;
whereupon they all rose up and took to flight. The Cogia, taking a
little bread in his hand, sat down on the side of the fountain, and
crumbling the bread in the fountain, fell to eating. A person coming
up, said, “What are you eating?” “Duck broth,” replied the Cogia.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One day the Cogia went with Cheragh Ahmed to the den of a wolf, in
order to see the cubs. Said the Cogia to Ahmed: “Do you go in.” Ahmed
did so. The old wolf was abroad, but presently returning, tried to get
into the cave to its young. When it was about half way in the Cogia
seized hard hold of it by the tail. The wolf in its struggles cast a
quantity of dust into the eyes of Ahmed. “Hallo, Cogia,” he cried,
“What does this dust mean.” “If the wolf’s tail breaks,” said the
Cogia, “You’ll soon see what the dust means.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One day a thief got into the Cogia’s house. Cries his wife, “O Cogia,
there is a thief in the house.” “Don’t make any disturbance,” says the
Cogia. “I wish to God that he may find something, so that I may take it
from him.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Cogia Effendi, every time he returned to his house, was in the habit
of bringing a piece of liver, which his wife always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span> gave to a common
woman, placing before the Cogia leavened patties to eat when he came
home in the evening. One day the Cogia said, “O wife, every day I bring
home a liver: where do they all go to?” “The cat runs away with all
of them,” replied the wife. Therefore the Cogia getting up, put his
hatchet in the trunk and locked it up. Says his wife to the Cogia,
“For fear of whom do you lock up the hatchet?” “For fear of the cat,”
replied the Cogia. “What should the cat do with the hatchet?” said the
wife. “Why,” replied the Cogia, “as he takes a fancy to the liver,
which costs two aspres, is it not likely that he will take a fancy to
the hatchet, which costs four?”</p>

<p>One day the Cogia, being out on a journey, encamped along with a
caravan, and tied up his horse along with the others. When it was
morning the Cogia could not find his horse amongst the rest, not
knowing how to distinguish it; forthwith taking a bow and arrow in his
hand, he said, “Men, men, I have lost my horse.” Every one laughing,
took his own horse; and the Cogia looking, saw a horse which he
instantly knew to be his own. Forthwith placing his right foot in the
stirrup, he mounted the horse, so that his face looked to the horse’s
tail. “O Cogia,” said they, “why do you mount the horse the wrong way?”
“It is not my fault,” said he, “but the horse’s, for the horse is
left-handed.”</p>

<p>One day as the Cogia was travelling in the Derbend he met a shepherd.
Said the shepherd to the Cogia. “Art thou a faquir?” “Yes,” said the
Cogia. Said the shepherd, “See these seven men who are lying here, they
were men like you whom I killed because they could not answer questions
which I asked. Now, in the first place let us come to an understanding;
if you can answer my questions let us hold discourse, if not, let us
say nothing.” Says the Cogia, “What may your questions be?” Said the
shepherd, “The moon, when it is new, is small, afterwards it increases,
until it looks like a wheel; after the fifteenth, it diminishes, and
does not remain; then again, there is a little one, of the size of
Hilal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span> which does remain. Now what becomes of the old moons?” Says
the Cogia. “How is it that you don’t know a thing like that? They take
those old moons and make lightning of them, have you not seen them when
the heaven thunders, glittering like so many swords?” “Bravo, Fakeer,”
said the shepherd. “Well art thou acquainted with the matter, I had
come to the same conclusion myself.”</p>

<p>One day the Cogia’s wife, in order to plague the Cogia, boiled some
broth exceedingly hot, brought it into the room and placed it on the
table. The wife then, forgetting that it was hot, took a spoon and
put some into her mouth, and, scalding herself, began to shed tears.
“O, wife,” said the Cogia, “what is the matter with you; is the broth
hot?” “Dear Efendy,” said the wife, “my mother, who is now dead loved
broth very much; I thought of that, and wept on her account.” The Cogia
thinking that what she said was truth, took a spoonful of the broth and
burning his mouth began to cry and bellow. “What is the matter with
you,” said his wife; “why do you cry?” Said the Cogia, “You cry because
your mother is gone, but I cry because her daughter is here.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One day a man came to the house of the Cogia and asked him to lend him
his ass. “He is not at home,” replied the Cogia. But it so happened
that the ass began to bray within. “O Cogia Efendy,” said the man, “you
say that the ass is not at home, and there he is braying within.” “What
a strange fellow you are!” said the Cogia. “You believe the ass, but
will not believe a grey bearded man like me.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One day the Cogia roasted a goose, and set out in order to carry it to
the Emperor. On the way, feeling very hungry, he cut off one leg and
ate it. Coming into the presence of the Emperor, he placed the goose
before him. On seeing it, Tamerlank said to himself, “The Cogia is
making game of me,” and was very angry, and demanded, “How happens it
that this goose has but one foot?” Said the Cogia, “In our country all
the geese have only one foot. If you disbelieve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span> me, look at the geese
by the side of that fountain.” Now at that time there was a flock of
geese by the rim of the fountain, all of whom were standing on one leg.
Timour instantly ordered that all the drummers should at once play up;
the drummers began to strike with their sticks, and forthwith all the
geese stood on both legs. On Timour saying, “Don’t you see that they
have two legs?” the Cogia replied, “If you keep up that drumming you
yourself will presently have four.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One day the Cogia’s wife, having washed the Cogia’s kaftan, hung it
upon a tree to dry; the Cogia going out saw, as he supposed, a man
standing in the tree with his arms stretched out. Says the Cogia to his
wife, “O wife, go and fetch me my bow and arrow.” His wife fetched and
brought them to him; the Cogia taking an arrow, shot it and pierced the
kaftan and stretched it on the ground; then returning, he made fast
his door and lay down to sleep. Going out in the morning he saw that
what he had shot was his own kaftan; thereupon, sitting down, he cried
aloud, “O God, be thanked; if I had been in it I should have certainly
been killed.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One day as the Cogia was going to his house, he met a number of
students, and said to them, “Gentlemen, pray this night come to our
house and taste a sup of the old father’s broth.” “Very good,” said the
students, and following the Cogia, came to the house. “Pray enter,”
said he, and brought them into the house, then going up to where his
wife was, “O wife,” said he, “I have brought some travellers that we
may give them a cup of broth.” “O master,” said his wife, “is there
oil in the house or rice, or have you brought any that you wish to
have broth?” “Bless me,” said the Cogia, “give me the broth pan,” and
snatching it up, he forthwith ran to where the students were, and
exclaimed, “Pray, pardon me gentlemen, but had there been oil or rice
in our house, this is the pan in which I would have served the broth up
to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span></p>

<p>One day the Cogia going into a person’s garden climbed up into an
apricot tree and began to eat the apricots. The master coming said,
“Cogia, what are you doing here?” “Dear me,” said the Cogia, “don’t
you see that I am a nightingale sitting in the apricot tree?” Said the
gardener, “Let me hear you sing.” The Cogia began to warble. Whereupon
the other fell to laughing, and said: “Do you call that singing?” “I am
a Persian nightingale,” said the Cogia, “and Persian nightingales sing
in this manner.”</p>

<p>From earliest times the stupid or blundering fellow has been the butt
of his comrades’ shafts of wit or sarcasm.</p>

<p>The feeling of superiority, so delightful to the human mind, found easy
expression in jeering at the discomfiture of the noodle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span></p>

<p>More often than not, noodle stories are told of residents of some
particular locality or district, whose people are looked upon as
simpletons. Doubtless this originally meant merely country people, who
were provincial or outlandish compared to the city bred.</p>

<p>But as the Greeks chose Bœotia for their noodle colony and the Persians
guyed the people of Emessa, so each country has had a location or a
community for its laughing stock down to the Gothamites of the English.</p>

<p>As a rule the same noodle stories are found in many languages, and only
an exhaustive study of comparative folk lore can adequately consider
the various tales.</p>

<p>As an instance, there is the story, of Eastern origin, that may be
found in the booby tales of all nations. It has come down in late years
in the form of a play, called in a German version, “Der Tisch Ist
Gedeckt” and in an English form, “The Obstinate Family.”</p>

<p>In the Arabian tale,</p>

<p>A blockhead, having married his pretty cousin, gave the customary feast
to their relations and friends. When the festivities were over, he
conducted his guests to the door, and from absence of mind neglected
to shut it before returning to his wife. “Dear cousin,” said his wife
to him when they were alone, “go and shut the street door.” “It would
be strange indeed,” he replied, “if I did such a thing. Am I just made
a bridegroom, clothed in silk, wearing a shawl and a dagger set with
diamonds, and am I to go and shut the door? Why, my dear, you are
crazy. Go and shut it yourself.” “Oh, indeed!” exclaimed the wife.
“Am I, young, robed in a dress, with lace and precious stones&mdash;am I
to go and shut the street door? No, indeed! It is you who are become
crazy, and not I. Come, let us make a bargain,” she continued; “and
let the first who speaks go and fasten the door.” “Agreed,” said the
husband, and immediately he became mute, and the wife too was silent,
while they both sat down, dressed as they were in their nuptial
attire, looking at each other and seated on opposite sofas. Thus they
remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span> for two hours. Some thieves happened to pass by, and seeing
the door open, entered and laid hold of whatever came to their hands.
The silent couple heard footsteps in the house, but opened not their
mouths. The thieves came into the room and saw them seated motionless
and apparently indifferent to all that might take place. They continued
their pillage, therefore, collecting together everything valuable, and
even dragging away the carpets from beneath them; they laid hands on
the noodle and his wife, taking from their persons every article of
jewellery, while they, in fear of losing the wager, said not a word.
Having thus cleared the house, the thieves departed quietly, but the
pair continued to sit, uttering not a syllable. Towards morning a
police officer came past on his tour of inspection, and seeing the door
open, walked in. After searching all the rooms and finding no person,
he entered their apartment, and inquired the meaning of what he saw.
Neither of them would condescend to reply. The officer became angry,
and ordered their heads to be cut off. The executioner’s sword was
about to perform its office, when the wife cried out, “Sir, he is my
husband. Do not kill him!” “Oh, oh,” exclaimed the husband, overjoyed
and clapping his hands, “you have lost the wager; go and shut the
door.” He then explained the whole affair to the police officer, who
shrugged his shoulders and went away.</p>

<p>Another story, known in a score of variants is found in a collection of
tales of the Kabaïl, Algeria, to this effect:</p>

<p>The mother of a youth of the Beni Jennad clan gave him a hundred reals
to buy a mule; so he went to market, and on his way met a man carrying
a water melon for sale. “How much for the melon?” he asks. “What will
you give?” says the man. “I have only got a hundred reals,” answered
the booby; “had I more, you should have it.” “Well,” rejoined the man,
“I’ll take them.” Then the youth took the melon and handed over the
money. “But tell me,” says he, “will its young one be as green as it
is?” “Doubtless,” answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span> the man, “it will be green.” As the booby
was going home, he allowed the melon to roll down a slope before him.
It burst on its way, when up started a frightened hare. “Go to my
house, young one,” he shouted. “Surely a green animal has come out of
it.” And when he got home, he inquired of his mother if the young one
had arrived.</p>

<p>Other stories of boobies or simpletons follow, taken here and there
from the enormous mass of humorous literature on this theme.</p>

<p>Yet noodles are not always witless fools.</p>

<p>The principle of the humor in such tales is merely and only the
superiority complex, that loves to laugh good naturedly or with a
contemptuous tolerance at the speech or actions of those less clever
than itself. It is the attitude of the cognoscenti toward,</p>

<p>One day some men were walking by the riverside, and came to a place
where the contrary currents caused the water to boil as in a whirlpool.
“See how the water boils!” says one. “If we had plenty of oatmeal,”
says another, “we might make enough porridge to serve all the village
for a month.” So it was resolved that part of them should go to the
village and fetch their oatmeal, which was soon brought and thrown into
the river. But there presently arose the question of how they were to
know when the porridge was ready. This difficulty was overcome by the
offer of one of the company to jump in, and it was agreed that if he
found it ready for use, he should signify the same to his companions.
The man jumped in, and found the water deeper than he expected. Thrice
he rose to the surface, but said nothing. The others, impatient at his
remaining so long silent, and seeing him smack his lips, took this for
an avowal that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span> porridge was good, and so they all jumped in after
him and were drowned.</p>

<p>A poor old woman used to beg her food by day and cook it at night.
Half of the food she would eat in the morning, and the other half in
the evening. After a while a cat got to know of this arrangement, and
came and ate the meal for her. The old woman was very patient, but at
last could no longer endure the cat’s impudence, and so she laid hold
of it. She argued with herself as to whether she should kill it or
not. “If I slay it,” she thought, “it will be a sin; but if I keep it
alive, it will be to my heavy loss.” So she determined only to punish
it. She procured some cotton wool and some oil, and soaking the one in
the other, tied it on to the cat’s tail and then set it on fire. Away
rushed the cat across the yard, up the side of the window, and on to
the roof, where its flaming tail ignited the thatch and set the whole
house on fire. The flames soon spread to other houses, and the whole
village was destroyed.</p>

<p>Not a few of the <i>Bizarrures</i> of the Sieur Gaulard are the
prototypes of bulls and foolish sayings of the typical Irishman,
which go their ceaseless rounds in popular periodicals, and are even
audaciously reproduced as original in our “comic” journals. To cite
some examples:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A friend one day told M. Gaulard that the Dean of Besançon was dead.
“Believe it not,” said he, “for had it been so he would have told me
himself, since he writes to me about everything.”</p>

<p>M. Gaulard asked his secretary one evening what hour it was. “Sir,”
replied the secretary, “I cannot tell you by the dial, because the sun
is set.” “Well,” quoth M. Gaulard, “and can you not see by the candle?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On another occasion the Sieur called from his bed to a servant desiring
him to see if it was daylight yet. “There is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span> no sign of daylight,”
said the servant. “I do not wonder,” rejoined the Sieur, “that thou
canst not see day, great fool as thou art. Take a candle and look with
it out at the window, and thou shalt see whether it be day or not.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In a strange house, the Sieur found the walls of his bed chamber full
of great holes. “This,” exclaimed he in a rage, “is the cursedest
chamber in all the world. One may see day all the night through.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Travelling in the country, his man, to gain the fairest way, rode
through a field sowed with pease, upon which M. Gaulard cried to him,
“Thou knave, wilt thou burn my horse’s feet? Dost thou not know that
about six weeks ago I burned my mouth with eating pease, they were so
hot?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A poor man complained to him that he had had a horse stolen from him.
“Why did you not mark his visage,” asked M. Gaulard, “and the clothes
he wore?” “Sir,” said the man, “I was not there when he was stolen.”
Quoth the Sieur, “You should have left somebody to ask him his name,
and in what place he resided.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>M. Gaulard felt the sun so hot in the midst of a field at noontide in
August that he asked of those about him, “What means the sun to be
so hot? How should it not keep its heat till winter, when it is cold
weather?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A proctor, discoursing with M. Gaulard, told him that a dumb, deaf, or
blind man could not make a will but with certain additional forms. “I
pray you,” said the Sieur, “give me that in writing, that I may send it
to a cousin of mine who is lame.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One day a friend visited the Sieur and found him asleep in his chair.
“I slept,” said he, “only to avoid idleness; for I must always be doing
something.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span></p>

<p>The Abbé of Poupet complained to him that the moles had spoiled a fine
meadow, and he could find no remedy for them. “Why, cousin,” said M.
Gaulard, “it is but paving your meadow, and the moles will no more
trouble you.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>M. Gaulard had a lackey belonging to Auvergne, who robbed him of twelve
crowns and ran away, at which he was very angry, and said he would have
nothing that came from that country. So he ordered all that was from
Auvergne to be cast out of the house, even his mule; and to make the
animal more ashamed, he caused his servants to take off its shoes and
its saddle and bridle.</p>

<p>Among the cases decided by a Turkish Kází, two men came before him
one of whom complained that the other had almost bit his ear off. The
accused denied this, and declared that the fellow had bit his own
ear. After pondering the matter for some time, the judge told them to
come again two hours later. Then he went into his private room, and
attempted to bring his ear and his mouth together; but all he did was
to fall backwards and break his head. Wrapping a cloth round his head,
he returned to court, and the two men coming in again presently, he
thus decided the question: “No man can bite his own ear, but in trying
to do so he may fall down and break his head.”</p>

<p>The typical noodle of the Turks, the Khoja Nasru ’d-Dín, quoted above
as Cogia Nasr Eddin Effendi, is said to have been a subject of the
independent prince of Karaman, at whose capital, Konya, he resided, and
he is represented as a contemporary of Timúr (Tamerlane), in the middle
of the fourteenth century. The pleasantries which are ascribed to him
are for the most part common to all countries, but some are probably of
genuine Turkish origin. To cite a few specimens: The Khoja’s wife said
to him one day, “Make me a present of a kerchief of red Yemen silk, to
put on my head.” The Khoja stretched out his arms and said, “Like that?
Is that large enough?” On her replying in the affirmative he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span> ran off
to the bazaar, with his arms still stretched out, and meeting a man on
the road, he bawled to him, “Look where you are going, O man, or you
will cause me to lose my measure!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One evening the Khoja went to the well to draw water, and seeing the
moon reflected in the water, he exclaimed, “The moon has fallen into
the well; I must pull it out.” So he let down the rope and hook, and
the hook became fastened to a stone, whereupon he exerted all his
strength, and the rope broke, and he fell upon his back. Looking into
the sky, he saw the moon, and cried out joyfully, “Praise be to Allah!
I am sorely bruised, but the moon has got into its place again.”</p>

<p>The Chinese have a story of a lady who had been recently married, and
on the third day saw her husband returning home, so she slipped quietly
behind him and gave him a hearty kiss. The husband was annoyed, and
said she offended all propriety. “Pardon! pardon!” said she. “I did not
know it was you.”</p>

<p>Indian fiction abounds in stories of simpletons, and probably the
oldest extant drolleries of the Gothamite type are found in the
<i>J[.a]takas</i>, or Buddhist Birth stories. Assuredly they were own
brothers to our mad men of Gotham, the Indian villagers who, being
pestered by mosquitoes when at work in the forest, bravely resolved,
according to <i>J[.a]taka</i> 44, to take their bows and arrows and
other weapons and make war upon the troublesome insects until they
had shot dead or cut in pieces every one; but in trying to shoot the
mosquitoes they only shot, struck, and injured one another. And nothing
more foolish is recorded of the Schildburgers than Somadeva relates,
in his <i>Kathá Sarit Ságara</i>, of the simpletons who cut down the
palm-trees: Being required to furnish the king with a certain quantity
of dates, and perceiving that it was very easy to gather the dates of
a palm which had fallen down of itself, they set to work and cut down
all the date-palms in their village, and having gathered from them
their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span> whole crop of dates, they raised them up and planted them again,
thinking they would grow.</p>

<p>In Málava there were two Bráham brothers, and the wealth inherited
from their father was left jointly between them. And while they were
dividing that wealth they quarrelled about one having too little and
the other having too much, and they made a teacher learned in the
Vedas arbitrator, and he said to them, “You must divide everything
your father left into two halves, so that you may not quarrel about
the inequality of the division.” When the two fools heard this, they
divided every single thing into two equal parts&mdash;house, beds, in fact,
all their property, including their cattle.</p>

<p>Henry Stephens (Henri Estienne), in the Introduction to his <i>Apology
for Herodotus</i>, relates some very amusing noodle-stories, such as of
him who, burning his shins before the fire, and not having wit enough
to go back from it, sent for masons to remove the chimney; of the fool
who ate the doctor’s prescription, because he was told to “take it”; of
another wittol who, having seen one spit upon iron to try whether it
was hot, did likewise with his porridge; and, best of all, he tells of
a fellow who was hit on the back with a stone as he rode upon his mule,
and cursed the animal for kicking him. This last exquisite jest has its
analogue in that of the Irishman who was riding on an ass one fine day,
when the beast, by kicking at the flies that annoyed him, got one of
its hind feet entangled in the stirrup, whereupon the rider dismounted,
saying, “Faith, if you’re going to get up, it’s time I was getting
down.”</p>

<p>The poet Ovid alludes to the story of Ino persuading the women of the
country to roast the wheat before it was sown, which may have come
to India through the Greeks, since we are told in the <i>Kathá Sarit
S[.a]gara</i> of a foolish villager who one day roasted some sesame
seeds, and finding them nice to eat, he sowed a large quantity of
roasted seeds, hoping that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span> similar ones would come up. The story
also occurs in Coelho’s <i>Contes Portuguezes</i>, and is probably of
Buddhistic origin. An analogous story is told of an Irishman who gave
his hens hot water, in order that they should lay boiled eggs!</p>

<p>Few folk-tales are more widely diffused than that of the man who set
out in quest of as great noodles as those of his own household. The
details may be varied more or less, but the fundamental outline is
identical, wherever the story is found; and, whether it be an instance
of the transmission of popular tales from one country to another, or
one of those “primitive fictions” which are said to be the common
heritage of the Aryans, its independent development by different
nations and in different ages cannot be reasonably maintained.</p>

<p>Thus, in one Gaelic version of this diverting story&mdash;in which our old
friends the Gothamites reappear on the scene to enact their unconscious
drolleries&mdash;a lad marries a farmer’s daughter, and one day while they
are all busily engaged in peat cutting, she is sent to the house to
fetch the dinner. On entering the house, she perceives the speckled
pony’s packsaddle hanging from the roof, and says to herself, “Oh, if
that packsaddle were to fall and kill me, what should I do?” and here
she began to cry, until her mother, wondering what could be detaining
her, comes, when she tells the old woman the cause of her grief,
whereupon the mother, in her turn, begins to cry, and when the old man
next comes to see what is the matter with his wife and daughter, and
is informed about the speckled pony’s packsaddle, he too, “mingles his
tears” with theirs. At last the young husband arrives, and finding the
trio of noodles thus grieving at an imaginary misfortune, he there
and then leaves them, declaring his purpose not to return until he
has found three as great fools as themselves. In the course of his
travels he meets with some strange folks: men whose wives make them
believe whatever they please&mdash;one, that he is dead; another, that he is
clothed, when he is stark naked; a third, that he is not himself. He
meets with the twelve fishers who always miscounted their number; the
noodles who went to drown an eel in the sea; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span> a man trying to get
his cow on the roof of his house, in order that she might eat the grass
growing there.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In Russian variants the old parents of a youth named Lutonya weep over
the supposititious death of a potential grandchild, thinking how sad
it would have been if a log which the old woman had dropped had killed
that hypothetical infant. The parents’ grief appears to Lutonya so
uncalled for that he leaves the house, declaring he will not return
until he has met with people more foolish than they. He travels long
and far, and sees several foolish doings. In one place a horse is
being inserted into its collar by sheer force; in another, a woman is
fetching milk from the cellar a spoonful at a time; and in a third
place some carpenters are attempting to stretch a beam which is not
long enough, and Lutonya earns their gratitude by showing them how to
join a piece to it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A well known English version is to this effect: There was a young man
who courted a farmer’s daughter, and one evening when he came to the
house she was sent to the cellar for beer. Seeing an axe stuck in a
beam above her head, she thought to herself, “Suppose I were married
and had a son, and he were to grow up, and be sent to this cellar for
beer, and this axe were to fall and kill him&mdash;oh, dear! oh dear!” and
there she sat crying and crying, while the beer flowed all over the
cellar floor, until her old father and mother come in succession and
blubber along with her about the hypothetical death of her imaginary
grown up son. The young man goes off in quest of three bigger fools,
and sees a woman hoisting a cow on to the roof of her cottage to
eat the grass that grew among the thatch, and to keep the animal
from falling off, she ties a rope round its neck, then goes into the
kitchen, secures at her waist the rope, which she had dropped down the
chimney, and presently the cow stumbles over the roof, and the woman
is pulled up the flue till she sticks half way. In an inn he sees a
man attempting to jump into his trousers&mdash;a favourite incident in this
class of stories; and farther along he meets with a party raking the
moon out of a pond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span></p>

<p>Another English variant relates that a young girl having been left
alone in the house, her mother finds her in tears when she comes home,
and asks the cause of her distress. “Oh,” says the girl, “while you
were away, a brick fell down the chimney, and I thought, if it had
fallen on me I might have been killed!” The only novel adventure which
the girl’s betrothed meets with, in his quest of three bigger fools, is
an old woman trying to drag an oven with a rope to the table where the
dough lay.</p>

<p>There is a Sicilian version in Pitrá’s collection, called <i>The
Peasant of Larcarà</i>, in which the bride’s mother imagines that her
daughter has a son who falls into the cistern. The groom&mdash;they are
not yet married&mdash;is disgusted, and sets out on his travels with no
fixed purpose of returning if he finds some fools greater than his
mother-in-law, as in the Venetian tale. The first fool he meets is a
mother, whose child, in playing the game called <i>nocciole</i>, tries
to get his hand out of the hole whilst his fist is full of stones. He
cannot, of course, and the mother thinks they will have to cut off
his hand. The traveller tells the child to drop the stones, and then
he draws out his hand easily enough. Next he finds a bride who cannot
enter the church because she is very tall and wears a high comb. The
difficulty is settled as in the former story. After a while he comes
to a woman who is spinning and drops her spindle. She calls out to the
pig, whose name is Tony, to pick it up for her. The pig does nothing
but grunt, and the woman in anger cries, “Well, you won’t pick it up?
May your mother die!” The traveller, who had overheard all this, takes
a piece of paper, which he folds up like a letter, and then knocks at
the door. “Who is there?” “Open the door, for I have a letter for you
from Tony’s mother, who is ill and wishes to see her son before she
dies.” The woman wonders that her imprecation has taken effect so soon,
and readily consents to Tony’s visit. Not only this, but she loads a
mule with everything necessary for the comfort of the body and soul of
the dying pig. The traveller leads away the mule with Tony, and returns
home so pleased with having found that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span> the outside world contains so
many fools that he marries as he had first intended.</p>

<p>In other Italian versions, a man is trying to jump into his stockings;

<p>Mediæval writers most frequently gave voice to short proverbs, maxims

Folk tales of India.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">San Shroe Bu</span><br />
<span class="subhed"><i>ENFORCED GREATNESS</i></span></h4>

<p class="p1">Once upon a time there lived a very poor middle aged couple on the
outskirts of a great and magnificent city. Early in the morning the man
used to set out to the city and return home in the evening with a few
odd annas earned by picking up small jobs in the warehouses of wealthy
merchants. One fine morning, being lazier than usual, he remained in
bed with his eyes closed though fully awake, and furtively watched the
proceedings of his wife during her toilette. When she was completely
satisfied with her performance the man pretended to wake up as though
from a deep sleep and addressed his wife, “you know, my dear, of late I
have been feeling that some strange power has been granted to me by the
gracious nats who preside over our destinies. To illustrate my point,
you saw just now that I was fast asleep, and yet, would you believe it,
I know exactly what you were doing a little while ago from the time you
rose from your bed up till the present moment,” and proceeded to tell
her all she did at her toilette. As may be imagined, his wife was quite
astonished at this feat, and womanlike, she began to see in this power
the means to a profitable living.</p>

<p>Just about this time the kingdom became greatly distracted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span> by a
series of daring thefts which took place both by day and night.
All efforts made by the authorities to capture the culprits proved
useless. At length the king became seriously alarmed for the safety of
his treasures, and in order to afford better protection he redoubled
the guards round the palace. But in spite of all this precaution the
thieves entered the palace one night and succeeded in carrying away a
large quantity of gold, silver and precious stones.</p>

<p>On the following morning the king issued a proclamation to the effect
that a thousand gold mohurs would be given as a reward to the person
who could either capture the thieves or restore the stolen property. So
without consulting her husband in whom she had absolute faith, she went
off to the palace and informed the king that her husband was a great
astrologer and that it would be quite easy for him to find the lost
treasures. The king’s heart was filled with gladness on receiving this
information. He told the good woman that if her husband could do all
that she promised, further honours and rewards would be heaped upon him.</p>

<p>When the woman returned home she joyfully related to her husband the
details of her interview with the king. “What have you done, you silly
fool?” shouted the man with mingled astonishment and alarm. “The other
day when I spoke to you about my powers I was merely imposing upon you.
I am neither an astrologer nor a diviner. It will be impossible for me
to find the lost property. By your silly act you have not only brought
disgrace upon us but you have also imperilled our lives. I don’t care
what happens to you; I only know that I am going to commit suicide this
very day.”</p>

<p>So saying he left the house and entered a dense forest with the
intention of cutting a stout creeper with which to hang himself. After
he got what he wanted he climbed up a big tree to tie one end of the
creeper to a branch. But while he was engaged in this act the notorious
thieves came to the foot of the very tree on which he was perched and
proceeded to divide the treasures which they stole from the palace. The
man on the top remained absolutely still and eagerly listened to all
that was going on down below. Apparently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span> the division was not quite
satisfactory to every one, and as a result a terrible dispute arose
among them. For long hours they argued and abused each other without
being able to come to a settlement. At length seeing that the sun was
already declining they agreed to bury the treasure at the foot of the
tree and to return on the morrow for a further discussion relative to
their respective shares.</p>

<p>As soon as they left the place the poor man came down from the tree and
ran home as fast as he could. “My dear wife, I know exactly where the
treasures are to be found. If you make haste and come along with me I
shall be able to remove the whole lot to our house.” So they hastened
together with baskets on their heads and reached the spot when darkness
had properly set in. They then dug up the treasures as quickly as they
could and conveyed them home.</p>

<p>On the following day they went to the palace and restored the lost
treasures to the king. Greatly overjoyed at his good fortune the king
praised the man and marvelled at his rare knowledge. In addition to the
reward which he received, the man was forthwith appointed the chief
astrologer to the King with a handsome salary which placed him beyond
the dreams of avarice.</p>

<p>While in the enjoyment of such honours and rewards the astrologer one
day thought to himself, “So far I have been very fortunate. My luck has
been phenomenally good. Everybody takes me to be a great man, though
actually I am not. I wonder for how long my luck will befriend me?”
From that time forward his mind became uneasy. He often sat up in bed
at nights dreading the future which should bring about his exposure
and disgrace. Every day he spoke to his wife about his false position
and the peril that threatened him. He saw that it would be utter folly
and madness to make a clean breast of everything as he had already
committed himself too far. So he decided to say nothing for the present
but to await a favourable opportunity of extricating himself from the
awkward situation.</p>

<p>It so happened that one day the king received a letter from the ruler
of a distant country which stated that he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span> heard about the famous
astrologer. But that somehow he did not quite believe all that was
said concerning the wisdom and knowledge of the man. By way of testing
his real powers would he, the king, enter into a bet? If acceptable,
he said he would send him a gourd fruit by his Envoys, and if his
astrologer could say how many seeds it contained, he was willing to
forfeit his kingdom provided he (the former) did the same in the
event of his protégé going wrong in his calculations. Having absolute
faith in his astrologer the king forthwith sent a reply to the letter
accepting the bet.</p>

<p>For many days after this the poor astrologer thought very hard how
he should act in the matter. He knew that the gourd fruit usually
contained thousands of seeds and that to attempt a guess would be worse
than useless. Being fully convinced that the day of reckoning had
at last arrived, he determined to run away and hide himself in some
obscure corner rather than face the disgrace of a public exposure. So
the next thing he did was to procure a boat. He then loaded it with
food for many days and quietly left the shores of the city.</p>

<p>The following day as he was nearing the mouth of the river, a foreign
vessel came sailing up under a full spread of canvas. He saw from a
distance that the sailors, having nothing particular to do, sat in a
group and were engaged in pleasant conversation. As he came alongside
the vessel he heard a man remark to the others, “Somehow I feel quite
certain that our king will lose the bet. Don’t you fellows know
that this country possesses an astrologer who is infallible in his
calculations? He is reputed to possess the combined sight of a thousand
<i>devas</i>. To such a one the single seed, lying hidden within this
gourd we now convey with us, will not prove an obstacle of any serious
difficulty. You may therefore rest assured that he will find it out in
a very short time.”</p>

<p>When the man heard these words he felt very glad and blessed his good
luck for having freed him once again from a dangerous situation.
Instead, therefore, of continuing his journey, he swung his boat round
and made for home, happy in the possession of his freshly acquired
knowledge. On his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span> arrival he related everything to his wife who shed
tears of joy on hearing the good news.</p>

<p>Early next day, hearing that the king was about to grant an audience
to the foreign Envoys, the royal astrologer went to the palace. The
courtiers were very glad to see him turn up, for so great was their
confidence in him that they felt that their country was quite safe and
that the chances were in favour of their acquiring a new kingdom. When
the king entered the Hall of Audience he invited the astrologer to sit
on his right while the others sat in front of him with their faces
almost touching the floor. Then the real proceedings began.</p>

<p>First of all presents were exchanged and complimentary speeches were
delivered on both sides. When these ceremonies were over the Chief
Envoy addressed the king in the following terms, “Oh Mighty Monarch!
The real object of our journey to your most beautiful country has
already formed the subject of correspondence between your Majesty and
my king. I will not therefore tire you by its recital all over again.
My master commands me to show you this gourd and to ask you to say how
many seeds exactly it contains. If what you say be correct his kingdom
passes into your possession, but on the other hand should you be wrong
your kingdom becomes the property of my master.”</p>

<p>Hearing these words the king smiled and turning to the astrologer near
him, said, “My dear <i>saya</i>, it is unnecessary for me to tell
you what you have got to do. Consult your stars and tell us how many
seeds the fruit contains. You already know how generous I have been
to you in the past. And now at this crisis, if you are able to assist
me in winning a kingdom, my reward to you shall be such as to make
you rejoice for all the remaining days of your life.” “Your Majesty,”
replied the astrologer, “everything I have, including my life, belongs
to you. By your will I am able to live, and by your will I must also
die. In the present case my calculations point to one answer only, and
therefore I have no hesitation in saying that this gourd contains one
seed only.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span></p>

<p>Accustomed to seeing gourds with thousands of seeds, the king
turned pale when he heard the astrologer’s answer. But still having
complete faith in him, with effort he restrained himself from further
questioning him. The gourd was then placed upon a gold plate and was
cut open in the presence of all those present. To the astonishment of
everybody there was but a single seed as was said by the astrologer.
The foreign Envoy congratulated the king on having won his bet and on
the possession of so valuable a servant. He then returned home with a
heavy heart bearing the news of his sovereign’s ruin and his country’s
misfortune.</p>

<p>As to the astrologer his fame spread far and wide. All sorts of
honours and rewards were heaped upon him. He was even granted the
unique privilege of entering or leaving any part of the palace at all
hours, just as his own inclinations directed him. Yet in spite of all
these things he was not happy. He knew he was an imposter who stood in
imminent danger of being found out. He was more than satisfied with
the reputation he had made and the riches he had acquired. He did not
desire any more of these things. His greatest ambition now was to find
a graceful way of escape from his false position.</p>

<p>So he thus spoke to his wife one day, “My dear wife, so far I have had
most wonderful luck. It has enabled me to escape two great dangers with
honour to myself. But how long will this luck stand by me? Something
tells me that I shall be found out on the third occasion. What I
propose to do next is this. Listen carefully so that you may carry out
my instructions without a hitch. Tomorrow while I am at the palace with
the king you must set fire to our house. Being of thatch and bamboo
it will not take long to be consumed. You must then come running to
the palace to inform me about it and at the same time you must keep on
repeating these words, ‘the Astrological Tables are gone.’ I will then
do the rest.”</p>

<p>On the following day while the king was holding a grand Durbar in the
Hall of Audience, a great commotion was heard outside the gates. On
enquiry the king was informed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span> that the astrologer’s wife had come to
inform her husband that their house was burnt down and that everything
of value, including the most precious astrological tables by which her
husband made his wonderful predictions, had been consumed by the fire.
Hearing these words the astrologer pretended to be terribly affected.
He struck his forehead with the palm of his hand and for a long time he
remained silent and motionless with grief. Then turning to the king he
said, “May it please your Majesty I am now utterly ruined. For had it
been my riches alone that perished in the fire I should not have minded
so much. They could have been easily replaced. But now since these
precious tables are gone it is impossible to procure a similar set from
anywhere else. I hope I have served your Majesty faithfully and to your
satisfaction in the past; but I grieve to say that I shall not be in
a position to give you the same service in the future. I beseech you
therefore to release me from the present responsible position, for I
shall no longer be useful to you. But in recognition of my past humble
services if your Majesty, in your great goodness of heart, can see fit
to grant me a small pension for the rest of my life I shall have cause
to consider myself exceptionally favoured.”</p>

<p>The king was very sad to hear of his favourite’s misfortune. And as
there was nothing else to be said or done in the matter he ordered a
beautiful building to be erected on the site of the house that was
burnt down. Next he filled it with a large retinue of servants and
other equipments such as horses, carriages and so forth. Then the whole
thing was made over to the astrologer with the command that for the
rest of his life he was to draw from the Royal Treasury no less a sum
than ten thousand gold mohurs a month.</p>

<p>As may be imagined the lucky astrologer was more than satisfied
with the arrangements and inwardly congratulated himself upon his
good fortune which once more enabled him to escape from a dangerous
situation. Thus some men are born great, some achieve greatness; but
there are also others who have greatness forced upon them, and it is
to this third and last class that our hero the pretentious astrologer
belongs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span></p>

<p>In the Middle Ages, popular sculpture and painting were but the
translation of popular literature, and nothing was more common to
represent, in pictures and carvings, than individual men under the
forms of the animals who displayed similar characters or similar
propensities. Cunning, treachery, and intrigue were the prevailing
vices of the middle ages, and they were those also of the fox, who
hence became a favourite character in satire. The victory of craft
over force always provoked mirth. The fabulists, or, we should perhaps
rather say, the satirists, soon began to extend their canvas and
enlarge their picture, and, instead of single examples of fraud or
injustice, they introduced a variety of characters, not only foxes, but
wolves, and sheep, and bears, with birds also, as the eagle, the cock,
and the crow, and mixed them up together in long narratives, which
thus formed general satires on the vices of contemporary society. In
this manner originated the celebrated romance of “Reynard the Fox,”
which in various forms, from the twelfth century to the eighteenth,
has enjoyed a popularity which was granted probably to no other book.
The plot of this remarkable satire turns chiefly on the long struggle
between the brute force of Isengrin the Wolf, possessed only with a
small amount of intelligence, which is easily deceived&mdash;under which
character is presented the powerful feudal baron&mdash;and the craftiness
of Reynard the Fox, who represents the intelligent portion of society,
which had to hold its ground by its wits, and these were continually
abused to evil purposes. Reynard is swayed by a constant impulse to
deceive and victimise everybody, whether friends or enemies, but
especially his uncle Isengrin. It was somewhat the relationship between
the ecclesiastical and baronial aristocracy. Reynard was educated in
the schools, and intended for the clerical order; and at different
times he is represented as acting under the disguise of a priest,
of a monk, of a pilgrim, or even of a prelate of the church. Though
frequently reduced to the greatest straits by the power of Isengrin,
Reynard has generally the better of it in the end: he robs and defrauds
Isengrin continually, outrages his wife, who is half in alliance
with him, and draws him into all sorts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span> of dangers and sufferings,
for which the latter never succeeds in obtaining justice. The old
sculptors and artists appear to have preferred exhibiting Reynard in
his ecclesiastical disguises, and in these he appears often in the
ornamentation of mediæval architectural sculpture, in wood-carvings,
in the illuminations of manuscripts, and in other objects of art. The
popular feeling against the clergy was strong in the middle ages, and
no caricature was received with more favour than those which exposed
the immorality or dishonesty of a monk or a priest. A sculpture in
the church of Christchurch, in Hampshire, represents Reynard in the
pulpit preaching; behind, or rather perhaps beside him, a diminutive
cock stands upon a stool&mdash;in modern times we should be inclined to
say he was acting as clerk. Reynard’s costume consists merely of the
ecclesiastical hood or cowl. Such subjects are frequently found on the
carved seats, or misereres, in the stalls of the old cathedrals and
collegiate churches. The painted glass of the great window of the north
cross-aisle of St. Martin’s church in Leicester, which was destroyed
in the last century, represented the fox, in the character of an
ecclesiastic, preaching to a congregation of geese.</p>

<p>Reynard’s mediæval celebrity dates certainly from a rather early
period. Montfaucon has given an alphabet of ornamental initial letters,
formed chiefly of figures of men and animals, from a manuscript which
he ascribes to the ninth century, among which is one representing
a fox walking upon his hind legs, and carrying two small cocks,
suspended at the ends of a cross staff. It is hardly necessary to say
that this group forms the letter T. Long before this, the Frankish
historian Fredegarius, who wrote about the middle of the seventh
century, introduces a fable in which the fox figures at the court of
the lion. The same fable is repeated by a monkish writer of Bavaria,
named Fromond who flourished in the tenth century, and by another named
Aimoinus, who lived about the year 1,000. At length, in the twelfth
century, Guibert de Nogent, who died about the year 1124, and who has
left us his autobiography (<i>de Vita Sua</i>), relates an anecdote
in that work, in explanation of which he tells us that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span> the wolf was
then popularly designated by the name of Isengrin; and in the fables
of Odo, as we have already seen, this name is commonly given to the
wolf, Reynard to the fox, Teburg to the cat, and so on with the others.
This only shows that in the fables of the twelfth century the various
animals were known by these names, but it does not prove that what we
know as the romance of Reynard existed. Jacob Grimm argued from the
derivation and forms of these names, that the fables themselves, and
the romance, originated with the Teutonic peoples, and were indigenous
to them; but his reasons seem more specious than conclusive, and
Paulin Paris holds that the romance of Reynard was native of France,
and that it was partly founded upon old Latin legends perhaps poems.
Its character is altogether feudal, and it is strictly a picture of
society, in France primarily, and secondly in England and the other
nations of feudalism, in the twelfth century. The earliest form in
which this romance is known is in the French poem&mdash;or rather poems, for
it consists of several branches or continuations&mdash;and is supposed to
date from about the middle of the twelfth century. It soon became so
popular, that it appeared in different forms in all the languages of
Western Europe, except in England, where there appears to have existed
no edition of the romance of Reynard the Fox until Caxton printed
his prose English version of the story. From that time it became, if
possible, more popular in England than elsewhere, and that popularity
had hardly diminished down to the commencement of the present century.</p>

<p>The popularity of the story of Reynard caused it to be imitated in a
variety of shapes, and this form of satire, in which animals acted the
part of men, became altogether popular.</p>

<p>A direct imitation of “Reynard the Fox” is found in the early French
romance of “Fauvel,” the hero of which is neither a fox nor an ass,
but a horse. People of all ranks and classes repair to the court of
Fauvel, the horse, and furnish abundant matter for satire on the moral,
political, and religious hypocrisy which pervaded the whole frame
of society. At length the hero resolves to marry, and, in a finely
illuminated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span> manuscript of this romance, preserved in the Imperial
Library in Paris, this marriage furnishes the subject of a picture,
which gives the only representation to be met with of one of the
popular burlesque ceremonies which were so common in the middle ages.</p>

<p>Among other such ceremonies, it was customary with the populace, on the
occasion of a man’s or woman’s second marriage, or an ill-sorted match,
or on the espousals of people who were obnoxious to their neighbours,
to assemble outside the house, and greet them with discordant music.
This custom is said to have been practiced especially in France, and
it was called a <i>charivari</i>. There is still a last remnant of it
in our country in the music of marrow-bones and cleavers, with which
the marriages of butchers are popularly celebrated; but the derivation
of the French name appears not to be known. It occurs in old Latin
documents, for it gave rise to such scandalous scenes of riot and
licentiousness, that the Church did all it could, though in vain, to
suppress it. The earliest mention of this custom, furnished in the
<i>Glossarium</i> of Ducange, is contained in the synodal statutes of
the church of Avignon, passed in the year 1337, from which we learn
that when such marriages occurred, people forced their way into the
houses of the married couple, and carried away their goods, which they
were obliged to pay a ransom for before they were returned, and the
money thus raised was spent in getting up what is called in the statute
relating to it a <i>Chalvaricum</i>. It appears from this statute, that
the individuals who performed the <i>charivari</i> accompanied the
happy couple to the church, and returned with them to their residence,
with coarse and indecent gestures and discordant music, and uttering
scurrilous and indecent abuse, and that they ended with feasting.
In the statutes of Meaux, in 1365, and in those of Hugh, bishop of
Beziers, in 1368, the same practice is forbidden, under the name of
<i>Charavallium</i>; and it is mentioned in a document of the year
1372, also quoted by Ducange, under that of <i>Carivarium</i>, as then
existing at Nîmes. Again, in 1445, the Council of Tours made a decree,
forbidding, under pain of excommunication, “the insolences, clamours,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
sounds, and other tumults practiced at second and third nuptials,
called by the vulgar a <i>Charivarium</i>, on account of the many and
grave evils arising out of them.” It will be observed that these early
allusions to the charivari are found almost solely in documents coming
from the Roman towns in the south of France, so that this practice
was probably one of the many popular customs derived directly from
the Romans. When Cotgrave’s “Dictionary” was published (that is, in
1632) the practice of the <i>charivari</i> appears to have become more
general in its existence, as well as its application; for he describes
it as “a public defamation, or traducing of; a foule noise made, blacke
santus rung, to the shame and disgrace of another; hence an infamous
(or infaming) ballad sung, by an armed troupe, under the window of an
old dotard, married the day before unto a young wanton, in mockerie of
them both.” And, again, a <i>charivaris de poelles</i> is explained
as “the carting of an infamous person, graced with the harmonie of
stinging kettles and frying-pan musicke.” The word is now generally
used in the sense of a great tumult of discordant music, produced often
by a number of persons playing different tunes on different instruments
at the same time.</p>

<p>The sermons and satires against extravagance in costume began at
an early period. The Anglo-Norman ladies, in the earlier part of
the twelfth century, first brought in vogue in our island this
extravagance in fashion, which quickly fell under the lash of satirist
and caricaturist. It was first exhibited in the robes rather than
in the head-dress. These Anglo-Norman ladies are understood to have
first introduced stays, in order to give an artificial appearance of
slenderness to their waists; but the greatest extravagance appeared in
the forms of their sleeves. The robe, or gown, instead of being loose,
as among the Anglo-Saxons, was laced close around the body, and the
sleeves, which fitted the arm tightly till they reached the elbows,
or sometimes nearly to the wrist, then suddenly became larger, and
hung down to an extravagant length, often trailing on the ground, and
sometimes shortened by means of a knot. The gown, also, was itself
worn very long. The clergy preached against these extravagances in
fashion, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span> at times, it is said, with effect; and they fell under
the vigorous lash of the satirist. In a class of satires which became
extremely popular in the twelfth century, and which produced in the
thirteenth the immortal poem of Dante&mdash;the visions of purgatory and of
hell&mdash;these contemporary extravagances in fashion are held up to public
detestation, and are made the subject of severe punishment. They were
looked upon as among the outward forms of pride. It arose, no doubt,
from this taste&mdash;from the darker shade which spread over men’s minds in
the twelfth century&mdash;that demons, instead of animals, were introduced
to personify the evil-doers of the time. Such is the figure, seen in a
very interesting manuscript in the British Museum (MS. Cotton. Nero, C
iv.). The demon is here dressed in the fashionable gown with its long
sleeves, of which one appears to have been usually much longer than
the other. Both the gown and sleeve are shortened by means of knots,
while the former is brought close round the waist by tight lacing.
It is a picture of the use of stays made at the time of their first
introduction.</p>

<p>This superfluity of length in the different parts of the dress was a
subject of complaint and satire at various and very distant periods,
and contemporary illuminations of a perfectly serious character show
that these complaints were not without foundation.</p>

<p>The professional entertainers of the Middle Ages performed in the
streets and public places, or in the theatres, and especially at
festivals, and they were often employed at private parties, to
entertain the guests at a supper.</p>

<p>We trace the existence of this class of performers during the earlier
period of the middle ages by the expressions of hostility towards
them used from time to time by the ecclesiastical writers, and the
denunciations of synods and councils. Nevertheless, it is evident from
many allusions to them, that they found their way into the monastic
houses, and were in great favour not only among the monks, but among
the nuns also; that they were introduced into the religious festivals;
and that they were tolerated even in the churches. It is probable
that they long continued to be known in Italy and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span> the countries
near the centre of Roman influence, and where the Latin language
was continued, by their old name of <i>mimus</i>. The Anglo-Saxon
vocabularies interpret the Latin <i>mimus</i> by <i>glig-mon</i>,
a gleeman. In Anglo-Saxon, <i>glig</i> or <i>gliu</i> meant mirth
and game of every description, and as the Anglo-Saxon teachers who
compiled the vocabularies give, as synonyms of <i>mimus</i>, the words
<i>scurra</i>, <i>jocifta</i>, and <i>pantomimus</i>, it is evident
that all these were included in the character of the gleeman, and that
the latter was quite identical with his Roman type. It was the Roman
<i>mimus</i> introduced into Saxon England. We have no traces of the
existence of such a class of performers among the Teutonic race before
they became acquainted with the civilisation of imperial Rome. We
know from drawings in contemporary illuminated manuscripts that the
performances of the gleeman did include music, singing, and dancing,
and also the tricks of mountebanks and jugglers, such as throwing up
and catching knives and balls, and performing with tamed bears, etc.</p>

<p>But even among the peoples who preserved the Latin language, the
word <i>mimus</i> was gradually exchanged for others employed to
signify the same thing. The word <i>jocus</i> had been used in the
signification of a jest, playfulness, <i>jocari</i> signified to jest,
and <i>joculator</i> was a word for a jester; but, in the debasement of
the language, <i>jocus</i> was taken in the signification of everything
which created mirth. It became, in the course of time the French verb
<i>jeu</i>, and the Italian <i>gioco</i>, or <i>giuoco</i>. People
introduced a form of the verb <i>jocare</i>, which became the French
<i>juer</i>, to play or perform. <i>Joculator</i> was then used in the
sense of <i>mimus</i>. In French the word became <i>jogléor</i>, or
<i>jougléor</i>, and in its later form <i>jougleur</i>. I may remark
that, in mediæval manuscripts, it is almost impossible to distinguish
between the <i>u</i> and the <i>n</i>, and that modern writers have
misread this last word as <i>jongleur</i>, and thus introduced into
the language a word which never existed, and which ought to be
abandoned. In old English, as we see in Chaucer, the usual form was
<i>jogelere</i>. The mediæval joculator, or jougleur, embraced all the
attributes of the Roman <i>mimus</i>, and perhaps more. In the first
place he was very often a poet himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span> and composed the pieces which
it was one of his duties to sing or recite. These were chiefly songs,
or stories, the latter usually told in verse, and so many of them are
preserved in manuscripts that they form a very numerous and important
class of mediæval literature. The songs were commonly satirical and
abusive, and they were made use of for purposes of general or personal
vituperation. Out of them, indeed, grew the political songs of a
later period. They carried about with them for exhibition tame bears,
monkeys, and other animals, taught to perform the actions of men. As
early as the thirteenth century, we find them including among their
other accomplishments that of dancing upon the tight-rope. Finally, the
jougleurs performed tricks of sleight of hand, and were often conjurers
and magicians. As, in modern times, the jougleurs of the middle ages
gradually passed away, sleight of hand appears to have become their
principal accomplishment, and the name only was left in the modern word
<i>juggler</i>. The jougleurs of the middle ages, like the mimi of
antiquity, wandered about from place to place, and often from country
to country, sometimes singly and at others in companies, exhibited
their performances in the roads and streets, repaired to all great
festivals, and were employed especially in the baronial hall, where, by
their songs, stories, and other performances, they created mirth after
dinner.</p>

<p>This class of society had become known by another name, the origin of
which is not so easily explained. The primary meaning of the Latin
word <i>minister</i> was a servant, one who ministers to another,
either in his wants or in his pleasures and amusements. It was applied
particularly to the cupbearer. In low Latinity, a diminutive of this
word was formed, <i>minestellus</i>, or <i>ministrellus</i>, a petty
servant, or minister. When we first meet with this word, which is
not at a very early date, it is used as perfectly synonymous with
<i>joculator</i>, and, as the word is certainly of Latin derivation,
it is clear that it was from it the middle ages derived the French
word <i>menestrel</i> (the modern <i>menetrier</i>), and the English
<i>minstrel</i>. The mimi or jougleurs were perhaps considered as
the petty ministers to the amusements of their lord, or of him who
for the time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span> employed them. Until the close of the middle ages, the
minstrel and the jougleur were absolutely identical. Possibly the
former may have been considered the more courtly of the two names. But
in England, as the middle ages disappeared, and lost their influence
on society sooner than in France, the word minstrel remained attached
only to the musical part of the functions of the old mimus, while, as
just observed, the juggler took the sleight of hand and the mountebank
tricks. In modern French, except where employed technically by the
antiquity, the word <i>menetrier</i> means a fiddler.</p>

<p>The jougleurs, or minstrels, formed a very numerous and important,
though a low and despised, class of mediæval society. The dulness of
every-day life in a feudal castle or mansion required something more
than ordinary excitement in the way of amusement, and the old family
bard, who continually repeated to the Teutonic chief the praises of
himself and his ancestors, was soon felt to be a wearisome companion.
The mediæval knights and their ladies wanted to laugh, and to make
them laugh sufficiently it required that the jokes, or tales, or comic
performances, should be broad, coarse, and racy, with a good spicing of
violence and of the wonderful. Hence the jougleur was always welcome
to the feudal mansion, and he seldom went away dissatisfied. But the
subject of the present chapter is rather the literature of the jougleur
than his personal history, and, having traced his origin to the Roman
mimus, we will now proceed to one class of his performances.</p>

<p>It has been stated that the mimus and the jougleurs told stories.
Of those of the former, unfortunately, none are preserved, except,
perhaps, in a few anecdotes scattered in the pages of such writers as
Apuleius and Lucian, and we are obliged to guess at their character,
but of the stories of the jougleurs a considerable number has been
preserved. It becomes an interesting question how far these stories
have been derived from the mimi, handed down traditionally from mimus
to jougleur, how far they are native in our race, or how far they were
derived at a later date from other sources. And in considering this
question, we must not forget that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span> mediæval jougleurs were not the
only representatives of the mimi, for among the Arabs of the East also
there had originated from them, modified under different circumstances,
a very important class of minstrels and story-tellers, and with these
the jougleurs of the west were brought into communication at the
commencement of the crusades. There can be no doubt that a very large
number of the stories of the jougleurs were borrowed from the East, for
the evidence is furnished by the stories themselves; and there can be
little doubt also that the jougleurs improved themselves, and underwent
some modification, by their intercourse with Eastern performers of the
same class.</p>

<p>The people of the middle ages, who took their word <i>fable</i> from
the Latin <i>fabula</i>, which they appear to have understood as a
mere term for any short narration, included under it the stories told
by the mimi and jougleurs; but, in the fondness of the middle ages
for diminutives, by which they intended to express familiarity and
attachment, applied to them more particularly the Latin <i>fabella</i>,
which in the old French became <i>fablel</i>, or, more usually,
<i>fabliau</i>. The fabliaux of the jougleurs form a most important
class of the comic literature of the middle ages. They must have been
wonderfully numerous, for a very large quantity of them still remain,
and these are only the small portion of what once existed, which have
escaped perishing like the others by the accident of being written in
manuscripts which have had the fortune to survive; while manuscripts
containing others have no doubt perished, and it is probable that many
were only preserved orally, and never written down at all. The recital
of these fabliaux appears to have been the favourite employment of
the jougleurs, and they became so popular that the mediæval preachers
turned them into short stories in Latin prose, and made use of them as
illustrations in their sermons. Many collections of these short Latin
stories are found in manuscripts which had served as note-books to the
preachers, and out of them was originally compiled that celebrated
mediæval book called the “Gesta Romanorum.”</p>

<p>The <i>Trouvères</i>, or poets, who wrote the Fabliaux flourished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
chiefly from the close of the twelfth century to the earlier part of
the fourteenth. They all composed in French, which was a language then
common to England and France, but some of their compositions bear
internal evidence of having been composed in England. No objection
appears to have been entertained to the recital of these licentious
stories before the ladies of the castle or of the domestic circle,
and their general popularity was so great, that the more pious clergy
seem to have thought necessary to find something to take their place
in the post-prandial society of the monastery, and especially of the
nunnery; and religious stories were written in the same form and metre
as the fabliaux. Some of these have been published under the title
of <i>Contes Devots</i>, and, from their general dulness, it may be
doubted if they answered their purpose of furnishing amusement so well
as the others.</p>

<p>Troubadour was the Provençal name for the <i>Trouvères</i>, and in
the twelfth century these poets flourished so luxuriantly that their
influence is still felt in the poetic sentiment of today.</p>

<p>Yet they were in no sense humorous writers, unless their satire on the
foibles and follies of the times may be so construed. They were Boudoir
poets and their airs and graces were romantic rather than mirthful.</p>

<p>Much of their production was of the languishing, sighing order, but the
Fabliaux, of a ruder narrative type were also popular.</p>

<p>These Fabliaux, now usually given out in expurgated editions, were
extremely plain spoken, and, as so often occurred, were adopted and
adapted by the monks for the real or pretended furtherance of their
religious teachings.</p>

<p>The Troubadours did much for lyric art by their conscientious attention
to form, but the humor of their productions is almost a negligible
quantity. Their songs were invariably sung, and usually to the
accompaniment of the blue-ribboned guitar, but oftenest the burden was
of sorrowful intent.</p>

<p>And it was, perhaps, owing to the want of a humorous sense, that the
Troubadours could carry on their lackadaisical and lovesick careers.</p>

<p>Yet there were some of the Troubadours’ songs which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span> showed a departure
from the usual romantic wailings and a few are here given.</p>

<p>Doubtless the very free translation adds to their humor, but the motive
is clear.</p>

<p>The Court of Love, a gay and whimsical institution, doubtless
originated in the contests of the Troubadours, when the poets recited
for a prize the particular style of an ode called the <i>Tenson</i>.</p>

<p>Though a fascinating subject, we may not dwell on it further than to
quote the thirty-one articles of the Code of Love, this being the most
available bit of humor.</p>

<ul class="smaller">
  <li>&ensp;1. Marriage is no legitimate excuse against love.</li>
  <li>&ensp;2. Whoever cannot conceal cannot love.</li>
  <li>&ensp;3. No one must have two lovers at the same time.</li>
  <li>&ensp;4. Love must always be increasing or diminishing.</li>
  <li>&ensp;5. Favours unwillingly granted have no charm.</li>
  <li>&ensp;6. No male must love until of full age.</li>
  <li class="hangingindent">&ensp;7. Whoever of two lovers survives the other must observe a widowhood of two years.</li>
  <li class="hangingindent">&ensp;8. None should be deprived of love except they lose their reason.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span></li>

  <li class="hangingindent">12. A true lover desires no embraces save those of his lady-love.</li>
  <li>13. Love divulged rarely lasts.</li>
  <li class="hangingindent">14. Easy winning makes love contemptible; difficulty renders it dear.</li>
  <li>15. Every lover grows pale at the sight of his lady-love.</li>
  <li class="hangingindent">16. The heart of a lover trembles at the sudden sight of his lady-love.</li>
  <li>17. A new love makes an old one depart.</li>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span></p>

<p>On these rules&mdash;some nonsensical, many contradictory, and all
abominable&mdash;the following decisions, among many others, were based.</p>

<p>The first is that of the Countess of Champagne already quoted, with its
approval by Queen Eleanor. In its original verbiage it runs thus:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Question.</i> Can true love exist between married persons?</p>

<p><i>Judgment</i>, by the Countess of Champagne: “We say and establish,
by the tenor of these presents, that love cannot extend its rights
to married persons. In fact, lovers accord everything to each other
mutually and gratuitously, without being constrained by motives of
necessity; while married people are bound by the duty of mutually
sacrificing their wills and refusing nothing the one to the other.</p>

<p>“Let this judgment, which we have given with extreme care, and after
taking counsel of a large number of ladies, be to you a constant and
irrefragable truth. Thus determined in the year 1174, the third day
before the kalends of May.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i> Do the greater affection and livelier attachment exist
between lovers or married people? [It having been already decided, let
us remember, that married people could not love one another.]</p>

<p><i>Judgment</i>, by Ermengarde, Viscountess of Narbonne: “The
attachment of married people and the tender affection of lovers are
sentiments of a nature and custom altogether different. There can
consequently be no just comparison established between objects which
have no resemblance or connection the one with the other.”</p>

<p><i>Question.</i> A lady attached to a gentleman in an honorable love
marries another. Has she the right to repel her former lover and refuse
him his accustomed favours?</p>

<p><i>Judgment</i>, by Ermengarde, Viscountess of Narbonne: “The
supervenience of the marriage bond does not bar the right of the prior
attachment, unless the lady utterly renounces love, and declares that
she does so for ever.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span></p>

<p>The <i>Gesta Romanorum</i>, one of the most important collections
of moral tales, was put together during the thirteenth century by a
learned Frenchman named Pierre Bercheure, who was a Benedictine Prior.
He chose to lay the scenes of the stories in Rome, though this was not
historically true. Gesta means merely acts or exploits, and many of the
tales are descended from Oriental Folk Lore.</p>

<p>Not all students of ancient literature agree as to the authorship of
the Gesta as it appears in its present form, but the consensus of
opinion seems to point to the aforesaid Frenchman.</p>

<p>However, the collector’s name matters little; the work itself, while it
harks back to the Fables of Æsop and Pilpay and to the <i>Talmud</i>,
is of interest as a veritable storehouse of Mediæval stories.</p>

<p>Each of these has its religious application, but it is easy to think
that the readers were oftener intrigued by the story than by the
appended moral.</p>


<h4><i>OF SLOTH</i></h4>

<p class="p1">The emperor Pliny had three sons, to whom he was extremely indulgent.
He wished to dispose of his kingdom, and calling the three into his
presence, spoke thus&mdash;“The most slothful of you shall reign after my
decease.” “Then,” answered the elder, “the kingdom must be mine; for
I am so lazy, that sitting once by the fire, I burnt my legs, because
I was too indolent to withdraw them.” The second son observed, “The
kingdom should properly be mine, for if I had a rope round my neck, and
held a sword in my hand, my idleness is such, that I should not put
forth my hand to cut the rope.” “But I,” said the third son, “ought to
be preferred to you both; for I outdo both in indolence. While I lay
upon my bed, water dropped from above upon my eyes; and though, from
the nature of the water, I was in danger of becoming blind, I neither
could nor would turn my head ever so little to the right hand or to
the left.” The emperor, hearing this, bequeathed the kingdom to him,
thinking him the laziest of the three.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span></p>


<h5><i>Application</i></h5>

<p>My beloved, the king is the devil; and the three sons, different
classes of corrupt men.</p>


<h4><i>OF THE GOOD, WHO ALONE WILL ENTER THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN</i></h4>

<p class="p1">There was a wise and rich king who possessed a beloved, but not a
loving wife. She had three illegitimate sons who proved ungrateful
and rebellious to their reputed parent. In due time she brought forth
another son, whose legitimacy was undisputed; and after arriving
at a good old age, he died, and was buried in the royal sepulchre
of his fathers. But the death of the old king caused great strife
amongst his surviving sons, about the right of succession. All of
them advanced a claim, and none would relinquish it to the other; the
three first, presuming upon their priority in birth, and the last upon
his legitimacy. In this strait, they agreed to refer the absolute
decision of their cause to a certain honourable soldier of the late
king. When this person, therefore, heard their difference, he said,
“Follow my advice, and it will greatly benefit you. Draw from its
sepulchre the body of the deceased monarch; prepare, each of you,
a bow and single shaft, and whosoever transfixes the heart of his
father, shall obtain the kingdom.” The counsel was approved, the body
was taken from its repository and bound naked to a tree. The arrow
of the first son wounded the king’s right hand&mdash;on which, as if the
contest were determined, they proclaimed him heir to the throne. But
the second arrow went nearer, and entered the mouth; so that he too
considered himself the undoubted lord of the kingdom. However, the
third perforated the heart itself, and consequently imagined that his
claim was fully decided, and his succession sure. It now came to the
turn of the fourth and last son to shoot; but instead of fixing his
shaft to the bow-string, and preparing for the trial, he broke forth
into a lamentable cry, and with eyes swimming in tears, said, “Oh! my
poor father; have I then lived to see you the victim of an impious
contest? Thine own offspring lacerate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span> thy unconscious clay?&mdash;Far,
oh! far be it from me to strike thy venerated form, whether living or
dead.” No sooner had he uttered these words, than the nobles of the
realm, together with the whole people, unanimously elected him to the
throne; and depriving the three barbarous wretches of their rank and
wealth, expelled them for ever from the kingdom.</p>


<h5><i>Application</i></h5>

<p>My beloved, that wise and rich king is the King of kings, and Lord
of lords, who joined himself to our flesh, as to a beloved wife. But
going after other gods, it forgot the love due to him in return, and
brought forth by an illicit connection, three sons, viz., Pagans,
Jews, and Heretics. The first wounded the right hand&mdash;that is, the
doctrine of Christ by persecutions. The second, the mouth&mdash;when they
gave Christ vinegar and gall to drink; and the third, wounded, and
continue to wound the <i>heart</i>,&mdash;while they strive, by every
sophistical objection, to deceive the faithful. The fourth son is any
good Christian.</p>


<h4><i>OF THE INCARNATION OF OUR LORD</i></h4>

<p class="p1">A certain king was remarkable for three qualities. Firstly, he
was braver than all men; secondly, he was wiser; and lastly, more
beautiful. He lived a long time unmarried; and his counsellors would
persuade him to take a wife. “My friends,” said he, “it is clear to
you that I am rich and powerful enough; and therefore want not wealth.
Go, then, through town and country, and seek me out a beautiful and
wise virgin; and if ye can find such a one, however poor she may be,
I will marry her.” The command was obeyed; they proceeded on their
search, until at last they discovered a lady of royal extraction with
the qualifications desired. But the king was not so easily satisfied,
and determined to put her wisdom to the test. He sent to the lady by
a herald a piece of linen cloth, three inches square; and bade her
contrive to make for him a shirt exactly fitted to his body. “Then,”
added he, “she shall be my wife.” The messenger, thus commissioned,
departed on his errand, and respectfully presented the cloth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span> with the
request of the king. “How can I comply with it,” exclaimed the lady,
“when the cloth is but three inches square? It is impossible to make a
shirt of that; but bring me a vessel in which I may work, and I promise
to make the shirt long enough for the body.” The messenger returned
with the reply of the virgin, and the king immediately sent a sumptuous
vessel, by means of which she extended the cloth to the required size,
and completed the shirt. Whereupon the wise king married her.</p>


<h5><i>Application</i></h5>

<p>My beloved, the king is God; the virgin, the mother of Christ; who
was also the chosen vessel. By the messenger, is meant Gabriel. The
cloth, is the Grace of God, which, by proper care and labour, is made
sufficient for man’s salvation.</p>


<h4><i>OF THE DECEITS OF THE DEVIL</i></h4>

<p class="p1">There were once three friends, who agreed to make a pilgrimage
together. It happened that their provisions fell short, and having
but one loaf between them, they were nearly famished. “Should this
loaf,” they said to each other, “be divided amongst us, there will
not be enough for any one. Let us then take counsel together, and
consider how the bread is to be disposed of.” “Suppose we sleep upon
the way,” replied one of them; “and whosoever hath the most wonderful
dream, shall possess the loaf.” The other two acquiesced, and settled
themselves to sleep. But he who gave the advice, arose while they
were sleeping, and eat up the bread, not leaving a single crumb for
his companions. When he had finished he awoke them. “Get up quickly,”
said he, “and tell us your dreams.” “My friends,” answered the first,
“I have had a very marvellous vision. A golden ladder reached up to
heaven, by which angels ascended and descended. They took my soul from
my body, and conveyed it to that blessed place where I beheld the Holy
Trinity; and where I experienced such an overflow of joy, as eye hath
not seen, nor ear heard. This is my dream.” “And I,” said the second,
“beheld the devils with iron instruments, by which they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span> dragged my
soul from the body, and plunging it into hell flames, most grievously
tormented me; saying, ‘As long as God reigns in heaven this will be
your portion.’” “Now then,” said the third, who had eaten the bread,
“hear my dream. It appeared as if an angel came and addressed me in
the following manner, ‘My friend, would you see what is become of your
companions?’ I answered, ‘Yes, Lord. We have but one loaf between us,
and I fear that they have run off with it.’ ‘You are mistaken,’ he
rejoined, ‘it lies beside us: follow me.’ He immediately led me to the
gate of heaven, and by his command I put in my head and saw you; and I
thought that you were snatched up into heaven and sat upon a throne of
gold, while rich wines and delicate meats stood around you. Then said
the angel, ‘Your companion, you see, has an abundance of good things,
and dwells in all pleasures. There he will remain for ever; for he has
entered a celestial kingdom and cannot return. Come now where your
other associate is placed.’ I followed, and he led me to hell-gates,
where I beheld you in torment, as you just now said. Yet they furnished
you, even there, with bread and wine in abundance. I expressed my
sorrow at seeing you in misery, and you replied, ‘As long as God reigns
in heaven here I must remain, for I have merited it. Do you then rise
up quickly, and eat all the bread, since you will see neither me nor
my companion again.’ I complied with your wishes; arose, and eat the
bread.”</p>


<h5><i>Application</i></h5>

<p>My beloved, the Saracens and Jews; the rich and powerful; and finally,
the perfect among men, are typified by the three companions. The bread,
represents the kingdom of heaven.</p>


<h4><i>OF VIGILANCE IN OUR CALLING</i></h4>

<p class="p1">A thief went one night to the house of a rich man, and scaling the
roof, peeped through a hole to examine if any part of the family were
yet stirring. The master of the house, suspecting something, said
secretly to his wife, “Ask me in a loud voice how I acquired the
property I possess; and do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span> not desist until I bid you.” The woman
complied, and began to vociferate, “My dear husband, pray tell me,
since you never were a merchant, how you obtained all the wealth which
you have now collected.” “My love,” answered her husband, “do not ask
such foolish questions.” But she persisted in her enquiries; and at
length, as if overcome by her urgency, he said, “Keep what I am going
to tell you a secret, and your curiosity shall be gratified.”</p>

<p>“Oh, trust me.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, you must know that I was a thief, and obtained what I now
enjoy by nightly depredations.” “It is strange,” said the wife, “that
you were never taken.” “Why,” replied he, “my master, who was a skilful
clerk, taught me a particular word, which, when I ascended the tops of
people’s houses, I pronounced, and thus escaped detection.” “Tell me, I
conjure you,” returned the lady, “what that powerful word was.” “Hear,
then; but never mention it again, or we shall lose all our property.”
“Be sure of that;” said the lady, “it shall never be repeated.”</p>

<p>“It was&mdash;is there no one within hearing?&mdash;the mighty word was
‘<span class="smcap">False</span>.’”</p>

<p>The lady, apparently quite satisfied, fell asleep; and her husband
feigned it. He snored lustily, and the thief above, who had heard
their conversation with much pleasure, aided by the light of the moon,
descended, repeating seven times the cabalistic sound. But being too
much occupied with the charm to mind his footing, he stepped through
the window into the house; and in the fall dislocated his leg and arm,
and lay half dead upon the floor. The owner of the mansion, hearing
the noise, and well knowing the reason, though he pretended ignorance,
asked, “What was the matter?” “Oh!” groaned the suffering thief,
“<i>False</i> words have deceived me.” In the morning he was taken
before the judge, and afterwards suspended on a cross.</p>


<h5><i>Application</i></h5>

<p>My beloved, the thief is the devil; the house is the human heart. The
man is a good prelate, and his wife is the church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span></p>

<p>To sum up, then, it would appear that the humorous muse in the Middle
Ages concerned herself chiefly with scattering and disseminating moral
lessons, which, because of the superiority of the teachers to the
taught, showed up an ignorance that was laughable.</p>

<p>The fables and maxims that had been passed from mouth to mouth were put
into writing and translated into various tongues.</p>

<p>The Sanscrit or Hindoo stories were undoubtedly the oldest and from
them were taken the Arabic and Persian tales. These drifted into Europe
and took a proper place among the literatures of the world.</p>

<p>Coleridge says that humor took its rise in the Middle Ages, while a
present day writer contradictingly asserts that nobody smiled from the
second century until the fifteenth.</p>

<p>It is true, that as the advent of Christianity put a full stop to all
progress in the arts and sciences so it impeded the advance of learning
and delayed the development of humor.</p>

<p>And yet, though men may not have smiled during the dark ages, they now
and then laughed, at a humor that was far from subtle, but which was
the foundation of the world’s merriment.</p>

<p>The monks and ecclesiastics who formulated the moral precepts for the
people found that the lessons were better conveyed by funny stories
than by serious ones, and the preachers came to use the hammer of
amusement to drive home their good advices.</p>

<h2>MODERN HUMOR</h2>
</div>

<p>With the readiness of the essayists to ascribe literary paternity,
Chaucer is called the Father of English Poetry.</p>

<p>Coleridge observes that he is the best representative in English of the
Norman-French Trouvères, but even more than by the French, Chaucer was
influenced by the great Italians, Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio, as
well as by Ovid and Virgil.</p>

<p>Father of Modern Poetry more correctly describes Chaucer, and as he was
the first notable English poet who was a layman, so also, was he the
first connected with the court.</p>

<p>Though his time, the Fourteenth Century, is practically in the Middle
Ages, Chaucer is distinctly modern in viewpoint and philosophy.</p>

<p>Born in London, he lived his life in the company of the men and women
of the circles he knew and loved. Mankind was his study and his theme.</p>

<p>The average reader is hampered by the difficulties of the early English
diction, and the modern mind is shocked by the freedom of speech then
in vogue.</p>

<p>But we append such bits of Chaucer’s verse as space allows.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The story of the Cock and the Fox, in the Nun’s Priest’s Tale, is
allowed by judges to be the most admirable fable (in the narration)
that ever was written. The description of the birds, the delightful
gravity with which they are invested with intellectual endowments, are
conceived in the highest taste of true poetry and natural humour.</p>

<p>The Troubadours and Minstrels were followed by a type of entertainer
known as the Fool or the Court Fool, who took the place of the satirist
in the great households.</p>

<p>Soon various jests were collected, and attributed to these domestic
fools, whose garb began to take the form of the cap and bells,
accompanied by the jester’s bauble.</p>

<p>As printing became more widespread, the jestbooks multiplied, and many
collections were published in England.</p>

<p>Skelton seems to have been quite as much Court Jester as Poet Laureate
under Henry VII and Henry VIII, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span> volume of <i>Merie Tayles of
Skelton</i> is one of the earliest of the Jest Books.</p>

<p>Yet, since this was published some forty years after Skelton’s death
it is assumed that but few of the tales are really of the poet’s
origination.</p>

<p>Likewise, Scogin’s Jests and the stories attributed to Tarlton and
Peele are considered unauthentic as to authorship and merely the work
of the hack writers of the period.</p>

<p>These Jestbooks as well as the <i>C. Mery Talys</i>, or <i>Hundred
Merry Tales</i>, which, with its companion volume, <i>Mery Tales and
Quicke Answeres</i>, was, we are told, used by Shakespeare, are now
found in many reprints, and only a few bits of their witty or humorous
lore may be given here.</p>

<p>As an example of the sharp satire of Skelton, the following shows how
he regarded the prevalent practice of obtaining letters patent of
monopoly from the crown, and also is a hit at the fondness for drinking
among the Welsh.</p>


<h4><i>HOW THE WELSHMAN DYD DESYRE SKELTON TO AYDE HIM IN HYS SUTE TO THE
KYNGE FOR A PATENT TO SELL DRYNKE</i></h4>

<p class="p1">Skelton, when he was in London went to the kynge’s courte, where there
dyd come to him a Welshman saying, “Syr, it is so that many dooth come
upp of my country to the kynge’s court, and some doth get of the kynge
by a patent a castell, and some a parke, and some a forest, and some
one fee and some another, and they doe lyve lyke honest men, and I
should lyve as honestly as the best, if I might have a patent for good
drynke, wherefore I dooe praye you to write a fewe woords for me in a
lytle byll to geve the same to the kynge’s handes, and I will geve you
well for your laboure. I am contented sayde Skelton. Syte downe, then,
sayd the Welshman and write. What shall I wryte? sayde Skelton. The
Welshman said wryte “<i>dryncke</i>.” Nowe sayde the Welshman wryte
“<i>more dryncke</i>.” What nowe? said Skelton. Wryte now “<i>A great
deale of dryncke</i>.” Nowe sayd the Welshman putte to all thys dryncke
“<i>A littell crome of breade</i>, and <i>a great déale of dryncke to
it</i>,” and reade once again. Skelton dyd reade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span> “<i>Dryncke, more
dryncke, and a great deale of dryncke and a lytle crome of breade and a
great deale of dryncke to it</i>.” Then the Welshman sayde Put oute the
litle crome of breade, and sette in <i>all dryncke and no breade</i>.
And if I myght have thys sygned of the kynge, sayde the Welshman, I
care for no more as long as I lyve. Well, then, sayde Skelton, when you
have thys sygned of the kynge then will I labour for a patent to have
bread, that you wyth your dryncke and I with the bread may fare well,
and seeke our livinge with bagge and staffe.</p>

<span class="subhed"><i>HOW JACKE BY SOPHISTRY WOULD MAKE OF TWO EGGS THREE</i></span></h4>

<p class="p1">Scogin on a tyme had two egs to his breakfast, and Jack his scholler
should rost them; and as they were rosting, Scogin went to the fire
to warme him. And as the egs were rosting, Jacke said: sir, I can by
sophistry prove that here be three egs. Let me se that, said Scogin.
I shall tel you, sir, said Jack. Is not here one? Yes, said Scogin.
And is not here two? Yes, said Scogin; of that I am sure. Then Jack
did tell the first egge againe, saying: is not this the third? O, said
Scogin, Jack, thou art a good sophister; wel, said Scogin, these two
eggs shall serve me for my breakfast, and take thou the third for thy
labour and for the herring that thou didst give mee the last day. So
one good turne doth aske another, and to deceive him that goeth about
to deceive is no deceit.</p>

<h4><i>HOW SCOGIN SOLD POWDER TO KILL FLEAS</i></h4>

<p class="p1">Scogin divers times did lacke money, and could not tell what shift
to make. At last, he thought to play the physician, and did fill a
box full of the powder of a rotten post; and on a Sunday he went to
a Parish Church, and told the wives that hee had a powder to kil up
all the fleas in the country, and every wife bought a pennyworth; and
Scogin went his way, ere Masse was done. The wives went home, and
cast the powder into their beds and in their chambers, and the fleas
continued still. On a time, Scogin came to the same Church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span> on a
sunday, and when the wives had espied him, the one said to the other:
this is he that deceived us with the powder to kill fleas; see, said
the one to the other, this is the selfe-same person. When Masse was
done, the wives gathered about Scogin, and said: you be an honest man
to deceive us with the powder to kill fleas. Why, said Scogin, are not
your fleas all dead? We have more now (said they) than ever we had. I
marvell of that, said Scogin, I am sure you did not use the medicine as
you should have done. They said: wee did cast it in our beds and in our
chambers. I, said he, there be a sort of fooles that will buy a thing,
and will not aske what they should doe with it. I tell you all, that
you should have taken every flea by the neck, and then they would gape;
and then you should have cast a little of the powder into every flea’s
mouth, and so you should have killed them all. Then said the wives: we
have not onely lost our money, but we are mocked for our labour.</p>

<p>Every one will have noticed that these old time jests are the
foundations on which many modern stories are built, but the last one
quoted above is so palpably the prototype of a current Boston story
that it must be told.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A small child named Halliwell, spending the night with a neighbor, Mrs.
Cabot, knelt at the knee of her hostess to say her evening prayer.</p>

<p>“Our Father who art in Heaven,” the little visitor began devoutly,
“Cabot be thy name&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What? What do you mean?” asked the startled lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span></p>

<p>“Oh,” said the child, “of course, at home, I say ‘Halliwell be thy
name,’ but here, I thought it more polite to say Cabot.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is held by most writers on the subject that the great influx of
humor into literature took place in the latter half of the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>This is partly because the progressing art of printing brought about
the influx of many elements into literature at that time, and also
because then appeared the work of three of the greatest of the world’s
humorists.</p>

<p>Shakespeare in England, Rabelais in France and Cervantes in Spain, gave
us their immortal works.</p>

<p>Earlier in the century Thomas More in his <i>Utopia</i> and Nicholas
Udall in his <i>Ralph Royster Doyster</i> wrote in humorously satiric
vein, but these works are difficult to quote from satisfactorily.</p>

<p>Having reached the period when Humor began to be produced in various
countries independently of one another, it becomes necessary to modify
our strict chronological arrangement and consider the nations and their
humorists separately.</p>

<p>Before this, broadly speaking, literature should be considered as a
whole, but as great names began to appear in certain widely separated
localities, a national division must be made.</p>

<p>And so, continuing in England, we come to William Shakespeare.</p>

<p>With Shakespeare’s greatness as a poet and dramatist we are not here
concerned, but there are some critics who dispute his preeminence as a
humorist.</p>

<p>While Hazlitt declared that in his opinion Molière was as great or
greater than Shakespeare as a comic genius; Doctor Johnson, on the
other hand, held that Shakespeare’s comedies are better than his
tragedies.</p>

<p>However, few are found to support Johnson’s opinion, and Hazlitt
qualifies his by saying that as Shakespeare’s imagination and poetry
were the master qualities of his mind, the ludicrous was forced to take
second place.</p>

<p>Both these worthies, however, agree on the question of Falstaff’s
greatness, and Hazlitt takes this attitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span></p>

<p>“I would not be understood to say that there are not scenes or whole
characters in Shakespeare equal in wit and drollery to anything upon
record. Falstaff alone is an instance, which, if I would, I could not
get over. He is the leviathan of all the creatures of the author’s
comic genius, and tumbles about his unwieldy bulk in an ocean of wit
and humour. But in general it will be found (if I am not mistaken),
that even in the very best of these the spirit of humanity and the
fancy of the poet greatly prevail over the mere wit and satire, and
that we sympathize with his characters oftener than we laugh at them.
His ridicule wants the sting of ill-nature. He had hardly such a thing
as spleen in his composition. Falstaff himself is so great a joke,
rather from his being so huge a mass of enjoyment than of absurdity.”</p>

<p>While with equal perceptive judgment “Falstaff,” says Dr. Johnson,
“unimitated, unimitable Falstaff, how shall I describe thee? Thou
compound of sense and vice; of sense which may be admired but not
esteemed; of vice which may be despised, but hardly detested! Falstaff
... is a thief and a glutton, a coward and a boaster, always ready to
cheat the weak and prey upon the poor; to terrify the timorous and
insult the defenceless. At once obsequious and malignant, he satirizes
in their absence those whom he lives by flattering.... Yet the man thus
corrupt, thus despicable, makes himself necessary to the Prince that
despises him, by the most pleasing of all qualities, perpetual gaiety,
by an unfailing power of exciting laughter, which is the more freely
indulged, as his wit is not of the splendid or ambitious kind, but
consists in easy scapes and sallies of levity, which make sport, but
raise no envy.”</p>

<p>One of the most difficult of all poets to quote from, we can only offer
detached and fugitive fragments of Shakespeare’s plays; beginning with
a bit quoted by Hazlitt and accompanied by his delightful observations
thereon.</p>

<p>“Shakespeare takes up the meanest subjects with the same tenderness
that we do an insect’s wing, and would not kill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span> a fly. To give a more
particular instance of what I mean, I will take the inimitable and
affecting, though most absurd and ludicrous dialogue, between Shallow
and Silence, on the death of old Double.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Shallow.</i> Come on, come on, come on; give me your hand, sir; give
me your hand, sir; an early stirrer, by the rood. And how doth my good
cousin Silence?</p>

<p><i>Silence.</i> Good morrow, good cousin Shallow.</p>

<p><i>Shallow.</i> And how doth my cousin, your bedfellow? and your
fairest daughter, and mine, my god-daughter Ellen?</p>

<p><i>Silence.</i> Alas, a black ouzel, cousin Shallow.</p>

<p><i>Shallow.</i> By yea and nay, sir; I dare say, my cousin William is
become a good scholar: he is at Oxford still, is he not?</p>

<p><i>Silence.</i> Indeed, sir, to my cost.</p>

<p><i>Shallow.</i> He must then to the inns of court shortly. I was once
of Clement’s inn; where, I think, they will talk of mad Shallow yet.</p>

<p><i>Silence.</i> You were called lusty Shallow then, cousin.</p>

<p><i>Shallow.</i> I was called anything, and I would have done anything
indeed, and roundly too. There was I, and little John Doit of
Staffordshire, and black George Bare, and Francis Pickbone, and Will
Squele, a Cotswold man, you had not four such swinge-bucklers in all
the inns of court again; and, I may say to you, we knew where the
bonarobas were, and had the best of them all at commandment. Then was
Jack Falstaff, now Sir John, a boy, and page to Thomas Mowbray, Duke of
Norfolk.</p>

<p><i>Silence.</i> This Sir John, cousin, that comes hither anon about
soldiers?</p>

<p><i>Shallow.</i> The same Sir John, the very same: I saw him break
Schoggan’s head at the court-gate, when he was a crack, not thus
high; and the very same day did I fight with one Sampson Stockfish, a
fruiterer, behind Gray’s-inn. O, the mad days that I have spent! and to
see how many of mine old acquaintances are dead!</p>

<p><i>Silence.</i> We shall all follow, cousin.</p>

<p><i>Shallow.</i> Certain, ’tis certain, very sure, very sure: death<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span> (as
the Psalmist saith) is certain to all, all shall die.&mdash;How a good yoke
of bullocks at Stamford fair?</p>

<p><i>Silence.</i> Truly cousin, I was not there.</p>

<p><i>Shallow.</i> Death is certain. Is old Double of your town living yet?</p>

<p><i>Silence.</i> Dead, sir.</p>

<p><i>Shallow.</i> Dead! see, see! he drew a good bow; and dead? he shot
a fine shoot. John of Gaunt loved him well, and betted much money on
his head. Dead! he would have clapped i’ th’ clout at twelve score; and
carried you a forehand shaft a fourteen and a half, that it would have
done a man’s heart good to see.&mdash;How a score of ewes now?</p>

<p><i>Silence.</i> Thereafter as they be: a score of good ewes may be
worth ten pounds.</p>

<p><i>Shallow.</i> And is old Double dead?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is not anything more characteristic than this in all Shakespeare.
A finer sermon on mortality was never preached. We see the frail
condition of human life, and the weakness of the human understanding
in Shallow’s reflections on it; who, while the past is sliding
from beneath his feet, still clings to the present. The meanest
circumstances are shown through an atmosphere of abstraction that
dignifies them: their very insignificance makes them more affecting,
for they instantly put a check on our aspiring thoughts, and remind us
that, seen through that dim perspective, the difference between the
great and little, the wise and foolish, is not much. ‘One touch of
nature makes the whole world kin’: and old Double, though his exploits
had been greater, could but have had his day. There is a pathetic
<i>naïveté</i> mixed up with Shallow’s commonplace reflections and
impertinent digressions. The reader laughs (as well he may) in reading
the passage, but he lays down the book to think. The wit, however
diverting, is social and humane. But this is not the distinguishing
characteristic of wit, which is generally provoked by folly, and spends
its venom upon vice.</p>

<p>The fault, then, of Shakespeare’s comic Muse is, in my opinion, that it
is too good-natured and magnanimous. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span> mounts above its quarry. It is
‘apprehensive, quick, forgetive, full of nimble, fiery, and delectable
shapes’: but it does not take the highest pleasure in making human
nature look as mean, as ridiculous, and contemptible as possible. It is
in this respect, chiefly, that it differs from the comedy of a later,
and (what is called) a more refined period.”</p>


<h4><i>FROM HENRY IV, PART I</i></h4>

<p class="p1 p-left"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Henry</span> <i>Prince of Wales and</i> <span class="smcap">Sir John
Falstaff</span>.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Falstaff.</i> Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?</p>

<p><i>Prince Henry.</i> Thou art so fat-witted with drinking of old
sack, and unbuttoning thee after supper, and sleeping upon benches
after noon, that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou
wouldst truly know. What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the
day? Unless hours were cups of sack, and minutes capons, and clocks
the tongues of bawds, and dials the signs of leaping-houses, and the
blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in flame-colored taffata, I see no
reason why thou should’st be so superfluous to demand the time of the
day.</p>

<p><i>Falstaff.</i> Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take
purses, go by the moon and seven stars; and not by Phœbus&mdash;he, “that
wand’ring knight so fair.” And, I pray thee, sweet wag, when thou art
king, as God save thy grace (majesty I should say; for grace thou wilt
have none)&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Prince Henry.</i> What! none?</p>

<p><i>Falstaff.</i> No, by my troth; not so much as will serve to be
prologue to an egg and butter.</p>

<p><i>Prince Henry.</i> Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.</p>

<p><i>Falstaff.</i> Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not us
that are squires of the night’s body, be called thieves of the day’s
beauty; let us be&mdash;Diana’s foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions
of the moon: and let men say, we be men of good government; being
governed, as the sea is, by our noble and chaste mistress the moon,
under whose countenance we&mdash;steal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span></p>

<p><i>Prince Henry.</i> Thou say’st well, and it holds well, too; for the
fortune of us, that are the moon’s men, doth ebb and flow like the sea;
being governed as the sea is, by the moon. As, for proof, now, a purse
of gold most resolutely snatched on Monday night, and most dissolutely
spent on Tuesday morning; got with swearing&mdash;<i>lay by</i>; and spent
with crying&mdash;<i>bring in</i>; now, in as low an ebb as the foot of the
ladder; and, by and by, in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.</p>

<p><i>Falstaff.</i> By the Lord, thou say’st true, lad. And is not my
hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?</p>

<p><i>Prince Henry.</i> As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle.
And is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?</p>

<p><i>Falstaff.</i> How now, how now, mad wag? what, in thy quips and thy
quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a buff jerkin?</p>

<p><i>Prince Henry.</i> Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of
the tavern?</p>

<p><i>Falstaff.</i> Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a time
and oft.</p>

<p><i>Prince Henry.</i> Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?</p>

<p><i>Falstaff.</i> No, I’ll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.</p>

<p><i>Prince Henry.</i> Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would
stretch; and where it would not I have used my credit.</p>

<p><i>Falstaff.</i> Yea, and so used it, that, were it not here apparent
that thou art heir apparent,&mdash;But, I pr’ythee, sweet wag, shall there
be gallows standing in England when thou art king? and resolution thus
fobbed as it is, with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do
not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.</p>

<p><i>Prince Henry.</i> No; thou shalt.</p>

<p><i>Falstaff.</i> Shall I? Oh, rare! By the Lord, I’ll be a brave judge.</p>

<p><i>Prince Henry.</i> Thou judgest false already; I mean thou shalt have
the hanging of the thieves, and so become a rare hangman.</p>

<p><i>Falstaff.</i> Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my
humor, as well as waiting in the court, I can tell you.</p>

<p><i>Prince Henry.</i> For obtaining of suits?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span></p>

<p><i>Falstaff.</i> Yea, for obtaining of suits; whereof the hangman hath
no lean wardrobe. ’Sblood, I am as melancholy as a gib-cat or a lugged
bear.</p>

<p><i>Prince Henry.</i> Or an old lion; or a lover’s lute.</p>

<p><i>Falstaff.</i> Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.</p>

<p><i>Prince Henry.</i> What say’st thou to a hare, or the melancholy of
Moor-ditch.</p>

<p><i>Falstaff.</i> Thou hast the most unsavory similes; and art, indeed,
the most comparative, rascalliest,&mdash;sweet young prince,&mdash;But Hal, I
pr’ythee trouble me no more with vanity. I would to God thou and I
knew where a commodity of good names were to be bought: an old lord of
the council rated me the other day in the street about you, sir; but I
marked him not; and yet he talked very wisely; but I regarded him not:
and yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.</p>

<p><i>Prince Henry.</i> Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the
streets and no man regards it.</p>

<p><i>Falstaff.</i> Oh, thou hast damnable iteration; and art, indeed,
able to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon me, Hal,&mdash;God
forgive thee for it! Before I knew thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and
now am I, if a man should speak truly, little better than one of the
wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give it over; by the
Lord, and I do not, I am a villain; I’ll be damned for never a king’s
son in Christendom.</p>

<p><i>Prince Henry.</i> Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?</p>

<p><i>Falstaff.</i> Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I’ll make one; an I do
not, call me villain, and baffle me.</p>

<p><i>Prince Henry.</i> I see a good amendment of life in thee; from
praying to purse-taking.</p>

<p><i>Dogberry.</i> Yea, marry, that’s the eftest way.&mdash;Let the watch come
forth.&mdash;Masters, I charge you, in the prince’s name, accuse these men.</p>

<p><i>1st Watch.</i> This man said, sir, that Don John, the prince’s
brother, was a villain.</p>

<h4><i>FROM THE MERCHANT OF VENICE</i></h4>

<p class="p1"><i>Launcelot.</i> Certainly, my conscience will serve me to run this
Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow, and tempts me, saying to
me, “Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good Launcelot,” or “good Gobbo,” or
“good Launcelot Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away.” My
conscience says, “No; take heed, honest Launcelot; take heed, honest
Gobbo”; or, as aforesaid, “honest Launcelot Gobbo; do not run; scorn
running with thy heels.” Well, the most courageous fiend bids me pack:
“Via!” says the fiend; “away!” says the fiend; “for the heavens, rouse
up a brave mind,” says the fiend, “and run.” Well, my conscience,
hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely to me, “My honest
friend Launcelot, being an honest man’s son,” or rather an honest
woman’s son; for, indeed, my father did something smack&mdash;something
grow to&mdash;he had a kind of taste&mdash;well, my conscience says, “Launcelot,
budge not.” “Budge,” says the fiend. “Budge not,” says my conscience.
“Conscience,” say I, “you counsel well.” “Fiend,” say I, “you counsel
well.” To be ruled by my conscience, I should stay with the Jew my
master, who&mdash;God bless the mark!&mdash;is a kind of devil; and to run
away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the fiend, who, saving your
reverence, is the devil himself. Certainly, the Jew is the very devil
incarnation; and, in my conscience, my conscience is a kind of hard
conscience to offer to counsel me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives
the more friendly counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels are at your
commandment; I will run.</p>


<h4><i>FROM HAMLET</i></h4>

<p class="center p1"><span class="smcap">Polonius</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>, <i>reading</i>.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Polonius.</i> How does my good Lord Hamlet?</p>

<p><i>Hamlet.</i> Well, God-’a’-mercy.</p>

<p><i>Polonius.</i> Do you know me, my lord?</p>

<p><i>Hamlet.</i> Excellent well; you are a fishmonger</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span></p>

<p><i>Polonius.</i> Not I, my lord.</p>

<p><i>Hamlet.</i> Then I would you were so honest a man.</p>

<p><i>Polonius.</i> Honest, my lord?</p>

<p><i>Hamlet.</i> Ay, sir: to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one
man picked out of ten thousand.</p>

<p><i>Polonius.</i> That’s very true, my lord.</p>

<p><i>Hamlet.</i> For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a good
kissing carrion&mdash;Have you a daughter?</p>

<p><i>Polonius.</i> I have, my lord.</p>

<p><i>Hamlet.</i> Let her not walk i’ the sun: conception is a blessing;
but not as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to’t.</p>

<p><i>Polonius.</i> How say you by that? (<i>Aside.</i>) Still harping on
my daughter. Yet he knew me not at first; he said I was a fishmonger.
He is far gone, far gone: and truly in my youth I suffered much
extremity for love; very near this. I’ll speak to him again.&mdash;What do
you read, my lord?</p>

<p><i>Hamlet.</i> Words, words, words.</p>

<p><i>Polonius.</i> What is the matter, my lord?</p>

<p><i>Hamlet.</i> Between who?</p>

<p><i>Polonius.</i> I mean the matter that you read, my lord.</p>

<p><i>Hamlet.</i> Slanders, sir. For the satirical slave says here, that
old men have gray beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
purging thick amber or plum-tree gum; and that they have a plentiful
lack of wit, together with weak hams. All of which, sir, though I most
powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it
thus set down; for you yourself, sir, shall grow old as I am: if, like
a crab, you could go backward.</p>

<p><i>Polonius.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) Though this be madness, yet there is
method in’t.&mdash;Will you walk out o’ the air, my lord?</p>

<p><i>Hamlet.</i> Into my grave?</p>

<p><i>Polonius.</i> Indeed, that is out o’ the air. (<i>Aside.</i>) How
pregnant sometimes his replies are! A happiness that often madness hits
on, which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of.
I will leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between
him and my daughter.&mdash;My honourable lord, I will most humbly take my
leave of you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span></p>

<p><i>Hamlet.</i> You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
willingly part withal: except my life, except my life, except my life.</p>

<p><i>Rosalind.</i> Then there is no true lover in the forest; else
sighing every minute, and groaning every hour, would detect the lazy
foot of Time as well as a clock.</p>

<p><i>Orlando.</i> And why not the swift foot of Time? Had not that been
as proper?</p>

<p><i>Rosalind.</i> By no means, sir. Time travels in divers paces with
divers persons. I’ll tell you, who Time ambles withal, who Time trots
withal, who Time gallops withal, and who he stands still withal.</p>

<p><i>Orlando.</i> I prithee, who doth he trot withal?</p>

<p><i>Rosalind.</i> Marry, he trots hard with a young maid, between the
contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnised: if the interim
be but a se’nnight, Time’s pace is so hard that it seems the length of
seven years.</p>

<p><i>Orlando.</i> Who ambles Time withal?</p>

<p><i>Rosalind.</i> With a priest that lacks Latin, and a rich man that
hath not the gout; for the one sleeps easily, because he cannot study;
and the other lives merrily, because he feels no pain: the one lacking
the burden of lean and wasteful learning; the other knowing no burden
of heavy, tedious penury. These Time ambles withal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span></p>

<p><i>Orlando.</i> Who doth he gallop withal?</p>

<p><i>Rosalind.</i> With a thief to the gallows; for though he go as
softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.</p>

<p><i>Orlando.</i> Who stays it still withal?</p>

<p><i>Rosalind.</i> With lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between
term and term, and then they perceive not how Time moves.</p>

<p><i>Orlando.</i> Where dwell you, pretty youth?</p>

<p><i>Rosalind.</i> Here in the skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a
petticoat.</p>

<p><i>Orlando.</i> Are you native of this place?</p>

<p><i>Rosalind.</i> As the cony, that you see dwell where she is kindled.</p>

<p><i>Orlando.</i> Your accent is something finer than you could purchase
in so removed a dwelling.</p>

<p><i>Rosalind.</i> I have been told of so many: but, indeed, an old
religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an
inland man; one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in
love. I have heard him read many lectures against it; and I thank God
I am not a woman, to be touched with so many giddy offences as he hath
generally taxed their whole sex withal.</p>

<p><i>Orlando.</i> Can you remember any of the principal evils that he
laid to the charge of women?</p>

<p><i>Rosalind.</i> There were none principal: they were all like one
another, as half-pence are; every one fault seeming monstrous, till its
fellow fault came to match it.</p>

<p><i>Orlando.</i> I prithee, recount some of them.</p>

<p><i>Rosalind.</i> No; I will not cast away my physic but on those that
are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that abuses our young
plants with carving Rosalind on their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns,
and elegies on brambles; all, forsooth, deifying the name of Rosalind:
if I could meet that fancy-monger I would give him some good counsel,
for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him.</p>

<p><i>Orlando.</i> I am he that is so love-shaked. I pray you, tell me
your remedy.</p>

<p><i>Rosalind.</i> There is none of my uncle’s marks upon you: he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span> taught
me how to know a man in love; in which cage of rushes, I am sure, you
are not prisoner.</p>

<p><i>Orlando.</i> What were his marks?</p>

<p><i>Rosalind.</i> A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye, and
sunken, which you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have
not; a beard neglected, which you have not (but I pardon you for that,
for, simply, your having in beard is a younger brother’s revenue.
Then, your hose shall be ungartered, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve
unbuttoned, your shoe untied, and everything about you demonstrating
a careless desolation. But you are no such man; you are rather
point-device in your accoutrements, as loving yourself, than seeming
the lover of any other.</p>

<p><i>Orlando.</i> Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.</p>

<p><i>Rosalind.</i> Me believe it? You may as soon make her that you love
believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to do than to confess she
does. That is one of the points in the which women still give the lie
to their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he that hangs the
verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind is so admired?</p>

<p><i>Orlando.</i> I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind,
I am that he, that unfortunate he.</p>

<p><i>Rosalind.</i> But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?</p>

<p><i>Orlando.</i> Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.</p>

<p><i>Rosalind.</i> Love is merely a madness; and, I tell you, deserves as
well a dark house and a whip as madmen do. And the reason why they are
not so punished and cured is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the
whippers are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.</p>

<p><i>Orlando.</i> Did you ever cure any so?</p>

<p><i>Rosalind.</i> Yes, one; and in this manner. He was to imagine me his
love, his mistress, and I set him every day to woo me: at which time
would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable,
longing, and liking; proud, fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant,
full of tears, full of smiles; for every passion something, and for
no passion truly anything,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span> as boys and women are, for the most part,
cattle of this colour: would now like him, now loathe him; then
entertain him, then forswear him; now weep for him, then spit at him;
that I drave my suitor from his mad humour of love, to a living humour
of madness, which was, to forswear the full stream of the world, and
to live in a nook merely monastic. And thus I cured him; and in this
way will I take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep’s
heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in’t.</p>

<p><i>Orlando.</i> I would not be cured, youth.</p>

<p><i>Rosalind.</i> I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind,
and come every day to my cote, and woo me.</p>

<p><i>Orlando.</i> Now, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it
is.</p>

<p><i>Rosalind.</i> Go with me to it, and I’ll show it you; and, by the
way, you shall tell me where in the forest you live. Will you go?</p>

<p><i>Orlando.</i> With all my heart, good youth.</p>

<h4><i>FROM “EVERY MAN IN HIS HUMOR”</i></h4>

<p class="p1"><i>Bobadil.</i> I will tell you, sir, by the way of private, and under
seal, I am a gentleman, and live here obscure, and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span> myself; but were
I known to her majesty and the lords (observe me), I would undertake,
upon this poor head and life, for the public benefit of the state, not
only to spare the entire lives of her subjects in general, but to save
the one-half, nay, three parts of her yearly charge in holding war, and
against what enemy soever. And how would I do it, think you?</p>

<p><i>E. Knowell.</i> Nay, I know not, nor can I conceive.</p>

<p><i>Bobadil.</i> Why, thus, sir. I would select nineteen more, to
myself, throughout the land; gentlemen they should be of good spirit,
strong and able constitution; I would choose them by an instinct, a
character that I have: and I would teach these nineteen the special
rules&mdash;as your punto, your reverso, your stoccata, your imbroccato,
your passado, your montanto&mdash;till they could all play very near, or
altogether as well as myself. This done, say the enemy were forty
thousand strong, we twenty would come into the field the tenth of
March, or thereabouts; and we would challenge twenty of the enemy; they
could not in their honor refuse us; well, we would kill them: challenge
twenty more, kill them; twenty more, kill them; twenty more, kill them
too; and thus would we kill every man his twenty a day, that’s twenty
score; twenty score, that’s two hundred; two hundred a day, five days
a thousand; forty thousand; forty times five, five times forty, two
hundred days kills them all up by computation. And this will I venture
my poor gentleman-like carcass to perform, provided there be no treason
practised upon us, by fair and discreet manhood; that is, civilly by
the sword.</p>


<h4><i>FROM “VOLPONE”</i></h4>

<p class="p1"><i>Volpone.</i> Lady, I kiss your bounty, and for this timely grace
you have done your poor Scoto, of Mantua, I will return you, over and
above my oil, a secret of that high and inestimable nature which shall
make you for ever enamoured on that minute, wherein your eye first
descended on so mean, yet not altogether to be despised, an object.
Here is a powder concealed in this paper, of which, if I should speak
to the worth, nine thousand volumes were but as one page, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span> page as
a line, that line as a word; so short is this pilgrimage of man, which
some call life, to the expression of it. Would I reflect on the price?
Why, the whole world is but as an empire, that empire as a province,
that province as a bank, that bank as a private purse to the purchase
of it. I will only tell you it is the powder that made Venus a goddess,
given her by Apollo, that kept her perpetually young, cleared her
wrinkles, firmed her gums, filled her skin, coloured her hair, from her
derived to Helen, and at the sack of Troy unfortunately lost: till now,
in this our age, it was as happily recovered, by a studious antiquary,
out of some ruins of Asia, who sent a moiety of it to the Court of
France, but much sophisticated, wherewith the ladies there now colour
their hair. The rest, at this present, remains with me, extracted to a
quintessence; so that, wherever it but touches in youth it perpetually
preserves, in age restores the complexion; seats your teeth, did they
dance like virginal jacks, firm as a wall; makes them white as ivory,
that were black as coal.</p>


<h4><i>A VINTNER</i>,</h4>

<p class="p1">To whom Jonson was in debt, told him that he would excuse the payment,
if he could give an immediate answer to the following questions: What
God is best pleased with; what the devil is best pleased with: what the
world is best pleased with; and what he was best pleased with. Jonson,
without hesitation, replied thus:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>God is best pleas’d, when men forsake their sin;</div>
        <div>The devil’s best pleas’d, when they persist therein:</div>
        <div>The world’s best pleas’d, when thou dost sell good wine;</div>
        <div>And you’re best pleas’d, when I do pay for mine.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>It was the fashion to flatter in those days, and King James had
abundance of such incense offered to him, though according to Ben
Jonson it was impossible to <i>flatter</i> so perfect a monarch.
The dramatist addressed the following epigram <i>To the Ghost of
Martial</i> (Ep. 36):</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">

        <div>Martial, thou gav’st far nobler epigrams</div>
        <div>To thy Domitian, than I can my James:</div>
        <div>But in my royal subject I pass thee,</div>
        <div>Thou flattered’st thine, mine cannot flatter’d be.</div>

        <div>Who says that Giles and Joan at discord be?</div>

        <div>But that his Joan doth too. And Giles would never</div>
        <div>By his free will be in Joan’s company;</div>
        <div>No more would Joan he should. Giles riseth early,</div>
        <div>And having got him out of doors is glad;</div>

        <div>Harsh sights at home, Giles wisheth he were blind;</div>
        <div>All this doth Joan. Or that his long-yearn’d life</div>
        <div>Were quite outspun; the like wish hath his wife.</div>

<h4><i>OBEDIENT HUSBANDS</i></h4>

<p class="p1">There is a humour incident to a woman, which is, when a young man
hath turmoiled himself so long that with much ado he hath gotten
into marriage, and hath perhaps met with a wife according to his own
desire, and perchance such an one that it had been better for him had
he lighted on another, yet he likes her so well that he would not have
missed her for any gold; for, in his opinion, there is no woman like
unto her. He hath a great delight to hear her speak, is proud of his
match, and is, peradventure, withal of so sheepish a nature, that he
has purposed to govern himself wholly by her counsel and direction,
so that if any one speak to him of a bargain, or whatsoever other
business, he tells them that he will have his wife’s opinion on it, and
if she be content, he will go through with it; if not, then will he
give it over.</p>

<p>Thus he is as tame and pliable as a jackanapes to his keeper. If the
Prince set forth an army, and she be unwilling that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span> should go,
who (you may think) will ask her leave, then must he stay at home,
fight who will for the country. But if she be desirous at any time to
have his room (which many times she likes better than his company),
she wants no journey to employ him in, and he is as ready as a page
to undertake them. If she chide, he answers not a word; generally,
whatsoever she does, or howsoever, he thinks it well done.</p>

<p>Judge, now, in what a case this silly calf is! Is not he, think you,
finely dressed, that is in such subjection? The honestest woman and
most modest of that sex, if she wear the breeches, is so out of reason
in taunting and controlling her husband&mdash;for this is their common
fault&mdash;and be she never so wise, yet a woman, scarce able to govern
herself, much less her husband and all his affairs; for, were it not
so, God would have made her the head. Which, since it is otherwise,
what can be more preposterous than that the head should be governed by
the foot?</p>

<p>If, then, a wise and honest woman’s superiority be unseemly, and breed
great inconvenience, how is he dressed, think you, if he light on a
fond, wanton, and malicious dame? Then doubtless he is soundly sped.
She will keep a sweetheart under his nose, yet is he so blind that he
can perceive nothing. But, for more security, she will many times send
him packing beyond sea, about some odd errand that she will buzz in his
ears, and he will perform it at her pleasure, though she send him forth
at midnight, in hail, rain, and snow, for he must be a man for all
weathers.</p>

<p>Their children, if they have any, must be brought up, apparelled,
taught, and fed according to her pleasure, and one point of their
learning is always to make no account of their father. Finally, she
orders all things as she thinks best herself, making no more account
of him, especially if he be in years, than men do of an old horse that
is put to labour. Thus is he mewed up, plunged in a sea of cares;
and yet he, kind fool, deems himself most happy in his happiness,
wherein he must now perforce remain while life doth last, and pity it
were he should want it, since he likes it so well.&mdash;<i>The Bachelor’s
Banquet.</i></p>

wrote rollicking verses as well as wise and serious sermons.</p>

<p>It may be that utter nonsense was more in vogue at this time than can
be definitely asserted, for such productions would, naturally, not be

<p>The following well-known and thoroughly characteristic verses
originally appeared in <i>Gammer Gurton’s Needle</i>, an old English
comedy, which was long supposed to be the earliest written in the
language, but which now ranks as the second in point of age. It was
written by John Still, afterwards Bishop of Bath and Wells.</p>

<p>Following the example of Jest Books and collections of Merry Tales,
came the Anthologies.</p>

<p>The most important of these was the <i>Miscellany</i>, which went
through eight editions in thirty years, and is said to be the book of
songs and sonnets that Master Slender missed so much.</p>

<p>This book was first published in 1557 and was followed by many less
worthy collections.</p>

<p>In 1576 appeared <i>The Paradise of Dainty Devices</i> which also ran
through many editions.</p>

<p>As a rule these collections were uninteresting and composed largely
of dull and prosy numbers. Their chief charm lay in their titles,
which were such as <i>A Gorgeous Gallery of Gallant Inventions</i>,
<i>A Handful of Pleasant Delights</i>, and <i>A Bouquet of Dainty
Conceits</i>.</p>

<p>Yet it must be remembered that this latter half of the Sixteenth
Century saw the splendid flowering of lyric poetry, and in the last
year appeared a famous book called <i>England’s Helicon</i> or <i>The
Muses’ Harmony</i>, which was a sort of Golden Treasury of the
Elizabethan age.</p>

<p>This was supplemented two years later by the <i>Poetical Rhapsody</i>,
edited by Francis Davison, and from then on, the collected songs and
verses of England showed poetry from the masters.</p>

<p>Also there were produced at this period many translations, both of
the classics and of more modern works of various countries; though no
important humorous work was translated until the next century, when
Urquhart gave Rabelais to the English people.</p>

    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>A priest there was in times of old,</div>
        <div>Fond of his church, but fonder of gold,</div>
        <div>Who spent his days and all his thought</div>
        <div>In getting what he preached was naught.</div>
        <div>His chests were full of robes and stuff,</div>
        <div>Corn filled his garners to the roof,</div>
        <div>Stored up against the fair-times gay,</div>
        <div>From Saint Rémy to Easter Day.</div>
        <div>An ass he had within his stable,</div>
        <div>A beast most sound and valuable.</div>
        <div>For twenty years he lent his strength</div>
        <div>For the priest, his master, till at length,</div>
        <div>Worn out with work and age, he died.</div>
        <div>The priest, who loved him, wept and cried;</div>
        <div>And, for his service long and hard,</div>
        <div>Buried him in his own churchyard.</div>
      </div>

   <div class="stanza">
        <div>Now turn we to another thing:</div>
        <div>’Tis of a bishop that I sing.</div>
        <div>No greedy miser he, I ween;</div>

        <div>His medicine best when he was ill.</div>
        <div>Always his hall was full, and there</div>
        <div>His guests had ever best of fare.</div>
        <div>Whate’er the bishop lack’d or lost</div>
        <div>Was bought at once despite the cost;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span></div>
        <div>And so, in spite of rent and score,</div>
        <div>The bishop’s debts grew more and more.</div>
        <div>For true it is&mdash;this ne’er forget&mdash;</div>
        <div>Who spends too much gets into debt.</div>
        <div>One day his friends all with him sat,</div>
        <div>The bishop talking this and that,</div>
        <div>Till the discourse on rich clerks ran,</div>
        <div>Of greedy priests, and how their plan</div>
        <div>Was all good bishops still to grieve,</div>
        <div>And of their dues their lords deceive.</div>
        <div>And then the priest of whom I’ve told</div>
        <div>Was mention’d; how he loved his gold.</div>
        <div>And because men do often use</div>
        <div>More freedom than the truth would choose,</div>
        <div>They gave him wealth, and wealth so much,</div>
        <div>As those like him could scarcely touch.</div>
        <div>“And then besides, a thing he’s done,</div>
        <div>By which great profit might be won,</div>
        <div>Could it be only spoken here.”</div>
        <div>Quoth the bishop, “Tell it without fear.”</div>
        <div>“He’s worse, my lord, than Bedouin,</div>
        <div>Because his own dead ass, Baldwin,</div>
        <div>He buried in the sacred ground.”</div>
        <div>“If this is truth, as shall be found,”</div>
        <div>The bishop cried, “a forfeit high</div>
        <div>Will on his worldly riches lie.</div>
        <div>Summon this wicked priest to me;</div>
        <div>I will myself in this case be</div>
        <div>The judge. If Robert’s word be true,</div>

        <div>Now, if this thing be proven, know</div>

        <div>Not that I fear to answer now&mdash;</div>

        <div>A leathern purse, well stocked and strung</div>
        <div>With twenty pieces fresh and bright,</div>
        <div>Good money all, none clipped or light.</div>

        <div>The bishop bent his head to hear,</div>
        <div>The priest he whispered in his ear:</div>
        <div>“Sir, spare a tedious tale to tell.</div>

        <div>“’Twas rightly done,” the bishop said,</div>
        <div>And gravely shook his godly head:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span></div>

a fuller by trade, is another one of the literary “Fathers,” his title
being, “Le Pere Joyeux du Vaudeville.” Born at Vire, surrounded by
valleys, it is held by some, while contradicted by others, that the
modern term vaudeville is a corruption of Vaux de Vire.</p>

<p>Francois Rabelais was born in or about 1495, in Chinon, Touraine.
Successively, monk, physician and scientist, he is best known as a
master of humor and grotesque invention. His romance of Gargantua and
Pantagruel is an extravagant, satirical criticism of the follies and
vices of the period, burlesquing the current abuses of government and
religion.</p>

<p>Unable to escape a paternal label,</p>

<p>An able writer in the <i>Foreign Quarterly Review</i> speaks of
Rabelais as “an author without parallel in the history of literature:
an author who is the literary parent of many authors, since without him
we should probably have never known a Swift, a Sterne, a Jean Paul, or,
in fact, any of the irregular humorists: an author who did not appear
as a steadily shining light to the human race, but as a wild, startling
meteor, predicting the independence of thought, and the downfall of
the authority of ages: an author who for the union of heavy learning
with the most miraculous power of imagination, is perhaps without a
competitor.”</p>

<p>The works of Rabelais abound in learning and serious intent, but the
riotous humor and flashing wit are presented with an accompaniment of
repulsive coarseness intolerable to the modern mind.</p>

<p>This phase, however, was a part of the manners and customs of his time,
and to philosophers and students Rabelais will ever be a mine of deep
and recondite wisdom and thought.</p>

<p>Indicative of his wildly extravagant fancy are the following extracts.</p>


<h4><i>OF THE ECLIPSES THIS YEAR</i></h4>

<p class="p1">This year there will be so many eclipses of the sun and moon, that I
fear (not unjustly) our pockets will suffer inanition, be full empty,
and our feeling at a loss. Saturn will be retrograde, Venus direct,
Mercury as unfixed as quicksilver. And a pack of planets won’t go as
you would have them.</p>

<p>For this reason the crabs will go side-long, and the rope-makers
backward; the little stools will get upon the benches, and the spits on
the racks, and the bands on the hats; fleas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span> will be generally black;
bacon will run away from peas in lent; there won’t be a bean left in a
twelfth cake, nor an ace in a flush; the dice won’t run as you wish,
tho’ you cog them, and the chance that you desire will seldom come;
brutes shall speak in several places; Shrovetide will have its day; one
part of the world shall disguise itself to gull and chouse the other,
and run about the streets like a parcel of addle-pated animals and mad
devils; such a hurly-burly was never seen since the devil was a little
boy; and there will be above seven and twenty irregular verbs made this
year, if Priscian don’t hold them in. If God don’t help us, we shall
have our hands and hearts full.</p>


<h4><i>OF THE DISEASES THIS YEAR</i></h4>

<p class="p1">This year the stone-blind shall see but very little; the deaf shall
hear but scurvily; the dumb shan’t speak very plain; the rich shall
be somewhat in a better case than the poor, and the healthy than the
sick. Whole flocks, herds, and droves of sheep, swine and oxen; cocks
and hens, ducks and drakes, geese and ganders, shall go to pot; but
the mortality will not be altogether so great among apes, monkeys,
baboons and dromedaries. As for old age, ’twill be incurable this year,
because of the years past. Those who are sick of the pleurisy will
feel a plaguy stitch in their sides; catarrhs this year shall distill
from the brain on the lower parts; sore eyes will by no means help the
sight; ears shall be at least as scarce and short in Gascony, and among
knights of the post, as ever; and a most horrid and dreadful, virulent,
malignant, catching, perverse and odious malady, shall be almost
epidemical, insomuch that many shall run mad upon it, not knowing what
nails to drive to keep the wolf from the door, very often plotting,
contriving, cudgeling and puzzling their weak shallow brains, and
syllogizing and prying up and down for the philosopher’s stone, tho’
they only get Midas’s lugs by the bargain. I quake for very fear when
I think on’t; for I assure you, few will escape this disease, which
Averroes calls lack of money, and by consequence of the last year’s
comet, and Saturn’s retrogradation, there will be a horrid clutter
between the cats and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span> rats, hounds and hares, hawks and ducks, and
eke between the monks and eggs.</p>


<h4><i>OF THE FRUITS OF THE EARTH THIS YEAR</i></h4>

<p class="p1">I find by the calculations of Albumazar in his book of the great
conjunction, and elsewhere, that this will be a plentiful year of
all manner of good things to those who have enough; but your hops
of Picardy will go near to fare the worse for the cold. As for oats
they’ll be a great help to horses. I dare say, there won’t be much
more bacon than swine. Pisces having the ascendant, ’twill be a mighty
year for muscles, cockles, and periwinkles. Mercury somewhat threatens
our parsly-beds, yet parsly will be to be had for money. Hemp will
grow faster than the children of this age, and some will find there’s
but too much on’t. There will be a very few <i>bon-chretiens</i>, but
choak-pears in abundance. As for corn, wine, fruit and herbs, there
never was such plenty as will be now, if poor folks may have their wish.</p>

<h4><i>RABELAIS IMITATES DIOGENES</i><br />
<span class="subhed">(<i>From the Author’s Prologue to Book III.</i>)</span></h4>

<p class="p1">When Philip, King of Macedon, enterprised the siege and ruin of
Corinth, the Corinthians having received certain intelligence by their
spies, that he with a numerous army in battle array was coming against
them, were all of them, not without cause, most terribly afraid; and,
therefore, were not neglective of their duty, in doing their best
endeavors to put themselves in a fit posture to resist his hostile
approach, and defend their own city. Some from the fields brought
into the fortified places their movables, cattle, corn, wine, fruit,
victuals and other necessary provisions. Others did fortify and rampire
their walls, set up little fortresses, bastions, squared ravelins,
digged trenches, cleansed countermines, fenced themselves with gabions,
contrived platforms, emptied casemates, barricaded the false brayes,
erected the cavalliers, repaired the contrescarpes, plaistered the
courtines,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span> lengthened ravelins, stopped parapets, mortised barbacans,
new pointed the portcullises with fine steel or good iron, fastened the
herses and cataracts, placed their sentries and doubled their patrol.</p>

<p>Every one did watch and ward, and not one was exempted from carrying
the basket. Some polished corselets, varnished backs and breasts,
cleaned the headpieces, mailcoats, brigandins, salads, helmets,
murrions, jacks, gushets, gorgets, hoguines, brassars and cuissars,
corselets, haubergeons, shields, bucklers, targets, greves, gauntlets
and spurs.</p>

<p>Others made ready bows, slings, cross-bows, pellets, catapults,
migraines or fire-balls, firebrands, balists, scorpions, and other such
warlike engines, repugnatory, and destructive to the Helepolides.</p>

<p>They sharpened and prepared spears, staves, pikes, brown bills,
halberts, long hooks, lances, zagages, quarterstaves, eelspears,
partisans, troutstaves, clubs, battle-axes, maces, darts, dartlets,
glaves, javelins, javelots, and truncheons.</p>

<p>They set edges upon scimetars, cutlasses, badelairs, backswords, tucks,
rapiers, bayonets, arrow-heads, dags, daggers, mandousians, poniards,
whinyards, knives, skenes, chipping knives, and raillons.</p>

<p>Diogenes seeing them all so warm at work, and himself not employed
by the magistrates in any business whatsoever, he did very seriously
(for many days together, without speaking one word) consider, and
contemplate the countenance of his fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>Then on a sudden, as if he had been roused up and inspired by a martial
spirit, he girded his cloak, scarf-ways, about his left arm, tucked
up his sleeves to the elbow, trussed himself like a clown gathering
apples, and giving to one of his old acquaintance his wallet, books,
and opistographs, away went he out of town towards a little hill or
promontory of Corinth called Craneum; and there on, the strand, a
pretty level place, did he roll his jolly tub, which served him for an
house to shelter him from the injuries of the weather: there, I say, in
a great vehemency of spirit, did he turn it veer it, wheel it, whirl
it, frisk it, jumble it, shuffle it, hurdle it, tumble it, hurry it,
jolt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span> it, jostle it, overthrow it, evert it, invert it, subvert it,
overturn it, beat it, thwack it, bump it, batter it, knock it, thrust
it, push it, jerk it, shock it, shake it, toss it, throw it, overthrow
it upside down, topsyturvy, tread it, trample it, stamp it, tap it,
ting it, ring it, tingle it, towl it, sound it, resound it, stop it,
shut it, unbung it, close it, unstopple it. And then again in a mighty
bustle he bandied it, slubbered it, hacked it, whittled it, wayed it,
darted it, hurled it, staggered it, reeled it, swinged it, brangled it,
tottered it, lifted it, heaved it, transformed it, transfigured it,

<p>Which when one of his friends had seen, and asked him why he did
so toil his body, perplex his spirit, and torment his tub? the
philosopher’s answer was, that not being employed in any other office
by the Republic, he thought it expedient to thunder and storm it so
tempestuously upon his tub, that amongst a people so fervently busy
and earnest at work, he alone might not seem a loitering slug and lazy
fellow. To the same purpose may I say to myself,&mdash;</p>

<p>For perceiving no account to be made of me towards the discharge of a
trust of any great concernment, and considering that through all the
parts of this most noble kingdom of France, both on this and on the
other side of the mountains, every one is most diligently exercised
and busied; some in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span> fortifying of their own native country, for
its defence; others, in the repulsing of their enemies by an offensive
war; and all this with a policy so excellent, and such admirable order,
so manifestly profitable for the future, whereby France shall have
its frontiers most magnifically enlarged, and the French assured of a
long and well-grounded peace, that very little withholds me from the
opinion of good Heraclitus, which affirmeth war to be the parent of all
good things; and therefore do I believe that war is in Latin called
<i>bellum</i>, not by antiphrasis, as some patchers of old rusty Latin
would have us to think, because in war there is little beauty to be
seen; but absolutely and simply; for that in war (<i>bellum</i> in
<i>Latin</i>) appears all that is good and graceful, <i>bon</i> and
<i>bel</i> in French, and that by the wars is purged out all manner
of wickedness and deformity. For proof whereof the wise and pacific
Solomon could no better represent the unspeakable perfection of the
divine wisdom, than by comparing it to the due disposure and ranking of
an army in battle array, well provided and ordered.</p>

<p>Therefore by reason of my weakness and inability, being reputed by my
compatriots unfit for the offensive part of warfare; and on the other
side, being no way employed in matter of the defensive, although it had
been but to carry burdens, fill ditches, or break clods, each whereof
had been to me indifferent, I held it not a little disgraceful to be
only an idle spectator of so many valorous, eloquent, and warlike
persons, who in the view and sight of all Europe act this notable
interlude or tragicomedy, and not exert myself, and contribute thereto
this nothing, my all; which remained for me to do. For, in my opinion,
little honor is due to such as are mere lookers on, liberal of their
eyes, and of their strength parsimonious; who conceal their crowns and
hide their silver; scratching their head with one finger like grumbling
puppies, gaping at the flies like tithe calves; clapping down their
ears like Arcadian asses at the melody of musicians, who with their
very countenances in the depth of silence express their consent to the
prosopopeia.</p>

<p>Having made this choice and election, it seemed to me that my exercise
therein would be neither unprofitable nor troublesome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span> to any, whilst I
should thus set agoing my Diogenical Tub.</p>


<h4><i>THE LOST HATCHET</i></h4>

<p class="p1">There once lived a poor honest country fellow of Gravot, Tom Wellhung
by name, a wood-cleaver by trade, who in that low drudgery made shift
so to pick up a sorry livelihood. It happened that he lost his hatchet.
Now tell me who ever had more cause to be vexed than poor Tom? Alas,
his whole estate and life depended on his hatchet; by his hatchet he
earned many a fair penny of the best wood-mongers or log-merchants,
among whom he went a-jobbing; for want of his hatchet he was like to
starve; and had Death but met him six days after without a hatchet, the
grim fiend would have mowed him down in the twinkling of a bed-staff.
In this sad case he began to be in a heavy taking, and called upon
Jupiter with most eloquent prayers (for, you know, necessity was the
mother of eloquence), with the whites of his eyes turned up toward
heaven, down on his marrow-bones, his arms reared high, his fingers
stretched wide, and his head bare, the poor wretch without ceasing was
roaring out by way of Litany at every repetition of his supplications,
“My hatchet, Lord Jupiter, my hatchet, my hatchet, only my hatchet,
oh, Jupiter, or money to buy another, and nothing else; alas, my poor
hatchet!”</p>

<p>Jupiter happened then to be holding a grand council about certain
urgent affairs, and old Gammer Cybele was just giving her opinion, or,
if you had rather have it so, it was young Phœbus the Beau; but, in
short, Tom’s outcry and lamentations were so loud that they were heard
with no small amazement at the council-board by the whole consistory
of the gods. “What a devil have we below,” quoth Jupiter, “that howls
so horridly? By the mud of Styx, haven’t we had all along, and haven’t
we here still, enough to do to set to rights a world of puzzling
businesses of consequence? Let us, however, despatch this howling
fellow below; you, Mercury, go see who it is, and discover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span> what he
wants.” Mercury looked out at heaven’s trapdoor, through which, as I
am told, they hear what’s said here below. By the way, one might well
enough mistake it for the scuttle of a ship; though Icaromenippus said
it was like the mouth of a well. The light-heeled deity saw that it
was honest Tom, who asked for his lost hatchet; and, accordingly, he
made his report to the Synod. “Marry,” said Jupiter, “we are finely
holped up, as if we had now nothing else to do here but to restore lost
hatchets. Well, he must have it for all that, for so ’tis written in
the Book of Fate, as well as if it was worth the whole Duchy of Milan.
The truth is, the fellow’s hatchet is as much to him as a kingdom to a
king. Come, come, let no more words be scattered about it; let him have
his hatchet again. Run down immediately, and cast at the poor fellow’s
feet three hatchets! his own, another of gold, and a third of massy
silver, all of one size; then, having left it to his will to take his
choice, if he take his own, and be satisfied with it, give him t’other
two. If he take another, chop his head off with his own; and henceforth
serve me all those losers of hatchets after that manner.”</p>

<p>Having said this, Jupiter, with an awkward turn of his head, like a
jackanapes swallowing pills, made so dreadful a phiz that all the
vast Olympus quaked again. Heaven’s foot-messenger, thanks to his
low-crowned, narrow-brimmed hat, and plume of feathers, heel-pieces,
and running-stick with pigeon-wings, flings himself out at heaven’s
wicket, through the empty deserts of the air, and in a trice nimbly
alights on the earth, and throws at friend Tom’s feet the three
hatchets, saying to him: “Thou hast bawled long enough to be a-dry; thy
prayers and requests are granted by Jupiter; see which of these three
is thy hatchet, and take it away with thee.”</p>

<p>Wellhung lifts up the golden hatchet, peeps upon it, and finds it very
heavy; then staring on Mercury cries, “Gadzooks, this is none of mine;
I won’t ha’t.” The same he did with the silver one, and said, “’Tis not
this either; you may e’en take them again.” At last, he takes up his
own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span> hatchet, examines the end of the helve, and finds his mark there;
then, ravished with joy, like a fox that meets some straggling poultry,
and sneering from the tip of the nose, he cries, “By the Mass, this
is my hatchet; Master God, if you will leave it me, I will sacrifice
to you a very good and huge pot of milk, brim full, covered with fine
strawberries, next Ides, <i>i.e.</i>, the 15th of May.”</p>

<p>“Honest fellow,” said Mercury, “I leave it thee; take it; and because
thou hast wished and chosen moderately, in point of hatchet, by
Jupiter’s command I give thee these two others; thou hast now wherewith
to make thyself rich: be honest.”</p>

<p>Honest Tom gave Mercury a whole cart-load of thanks, and paid reverence
to the most great Jupiter. His old hatchet he fastened close to his
leathern girdle, and girds it about his breech like Martin of Cambray;
the two others, being more heavy, he lays on his shoulder. Thus he
plods on, trudging over the fields, keeping a good countenance among
his neighbors and fellow-parishioners, with one merry saying or other,
after Patelin’s way.</p>

<p>The next day, having put on a clean white jacket, he takes on his
back the two precious hatchets, and comes to Chinon, the famous city,
noble city, ancient city, yea, the first city in the world, according
to the judgment and assertion of the most learned Massoreths. In
Chinon he turned his silver hatchet into fine testons, crown-pieces,
and other white cash; his golden hatchet into fine angels, curious
ducats, substantial ridders, spankers, and rose nobles. Then with
them purchases a good number of farms, barns, houses, outhouses,
thatch-houses, stables, meadows, orchards, fields, vineyards, woods,
arable lands, pastures, ponds, mills, gardens, nurseries, oxen,
cows, sheep, goats, swine, hogs, asses, horses, hens, cocks, capons,
chickens, geese, ganders, ducks, drakes, and a world of all other
necessaries, and in a short time became the richest man in all the
country. His brother bumpkins, and the yeomen and other country-puts
thereabout, perceiving his good fortune, were not a little amazed,
insomuch that their former pity of poor Tom was soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span> changed into an
envy of his so great and unexpected rise; and, as they could not for
their souls devise how this came about, they made it their business to
pry up and down, and lay their heads together, to inquire, seek, and
inform themselves by what means, in what place, on what day, what hour,
how, why, and wherefore, he had come by this great treasure.</p>

<p>At last, hearing it was by losing his hatchet, “Ha, ha!” said they,
“was there no more to do, but to lose a hatchet, to make us rich?” With
this they all fairly lost their hatchets out of hand. The devil a one
that had a hatchet left; he was not his mother’s son, that did not lose
his hatchet. No more was wood felled or cleared in that country through
want of hatchets. Nay, the Æsopian apologue even saith, that certain
petty country gents, of the lower class, who had sold Wellhung their
little mill and little field to have wherewithal to make a figure at
the next muster, having been told that this treasure was come to him by
that means only, sold the only badge of their gentility, their swords,
to purchase hatchets to go to lose them, as the silly clodpates did, in
hopes to gain store of coin by that loss.</p>

<p>You would have truly sworn they had been a parcel of your petty
spiritual usurers, Rome-bound, selling their all, and borrowing of
others to buy store of mandates, a pennyworth of a new-made pope.</p>

<p>Now they cried out and brayed, and prayed and bawled, and lamented and
invoked Jupiter, “My hatchet! My hatchet! Jupiter, my hatchet!” On this
side, “My hatchet!” On that side, “My hatchet! Ho, ho, ho, ho, Jupiter,
my hatchet!” The air round about rung again with the cries and howlings
of these rascally losers of hatchets.</p>

<p>Mercury was nimble in bringing them hatchets; to each offering that
which he had lost, as also another of gold, and a third of silver.</p>

<p>Everywhere he still was for that of gold, giving thanks in abundance
to the great giver Jupiter; but in the very nick of time, that they
bowed and stooped to take it from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span> ground, whip in a trice, Mercury
lopped off their heads, as Jupiter had commanded. And of heads thus cut
off, the number was just equal to that of the lost hatchets.</p>

<p class="r2 p-min">&mdash;<i>Gargantua and Pantagruel.</i></p>

<p>There is an epigram in Martial, and one of the very good ones&mdash;for he
has all sorts&mdash;where he pleasantly tells the story of Cælius, who, to
avoid making his court to some great men of Rome, to wait their rising,
and to attend them abroad, pretended to have the gout; and the better
to color this, anointed his legs and had them lapped up in a great many
swathings, and perfectly counterfeited both the gesture and countenance
of a gouty person; till in the end, Fortune did him the kindness to
make him one indeed.</p>

<p>I think I have read somewhere in Appian, a story like this, of one who
to escape the proscriptions of the triumvirs of Rome, and the better to
be concealed from the discovery of those who pursued him, having hidden
himself in a disguise, would yet add this invention, to counterfeit
having but one eye; but when he came to have a little more liberty,
and went to take off the plaster he had a great while worn over his
eye, he found he had totally lost the sight of it indeed, and that it
was absolutely gone. ’Tis possible that the action of sight was dulled
from having been so long without exercise, and that the optic power
was wholly retired into the other eye for we evidently perceive that
the eye we keep shut sends some part of its virtue to its fellow, so
that it will swell and grow bigger; and so, inaction, with the heat of
ligatures and plaster might very well have brought some gouty humor
upon this dissembler of Martial.</p>

<p>Reading in Froissart the vow of a troop of young English gallants,
to keep their left eyes bound up till they had arrived in France and
performed some notable exploit upon us, I have often been tickled with
the conceit: suppose it had befallen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span> them as it did the Roman, and
they had returned with but one eye apiece to their mistresses, for
whose sakes they had made his ridiculous vow.</p>

<p>Mothers have reason to rebuke their children when they counterfeit
having but one eye, squinting, lameness, or any other personal defect;
for, besides that their bodies being then so tender may be subject to
take an ill bent, Fortune, I know not how, sometimes seems to delight
in taking us at our word; and I have heard several examples related
of people who have become really sick, by only feigning to be so. I
have always used, whether on horseback or on foot, to carry a stick in
my hand, and even to affect doing it with an elegant air; many have
threatened that this fancy would one day be turned into necessity: if
so, I should be the first of my family to have the gout.</p>

<p>But let us a little lengthen this chapter, and add another anecdote
concerning blindness. Pliny reports of one who, dreaming he was blind,
found himself so indeed in the morning without any preceding infirmity
in his eyes. The force of imagination might assist in this case, as I
have said elsewhere, and Pliny seems to be of the same opinion; but it
is more likely that the motions which the body felt within, of which
physicians, if they please, may find out the cause, taking away his
sight, were the occasion of his dream.</p>

<p>Let us add another story, not very improper for this subject, which
Seneca relates in one of his epistles: “You know,” says he, writing
to Lucilius, “that Harpaste, my wife’s fool, is thrown upon me as an
hereditary charge for I have naturally an aversion to those monsters;
and if I have a mind to laugh at a fool, I need not seek him far, I
can laugh at myself. This fool has suddenly lost her sight: I tell
you a strange, but a very true thing; she is not sensible that she is
blind, but eternally importunes her keeper to take her abroad, because
she says the house is dark. That what we laugh at in her, I pray you
to believe, happens to every one of us: no one knows himself to be
avaricious or grasping: and again, the blind call for a guide, while we
stray of our own accord. I am not ambitious, we say; but a man cannot
live otherwise at Rome; I am not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span> wasteful, but the city requires a
great outlay; ’tis not my fault if I am choleric&mdash;if I have not yet
established any certain course of life: ’tis the fault of youth. Let us
not seek our disease out of ourselves; ’tis in us, and planted in our
bowels; and the mere fact that we do not perceive ourselves to be sick,
renders us more hard to be cured. If we do not betimes begin to see to
ourselves, when shall we have provided for so many wounds and evils
wherewith we abound? And yet we have a most sweet and charming medicine
in philosophy; for of all the rest we are sensible of no pleasure till
after the cure: this pleases and heals at once.” This is what Seneca
says, that has carried me from my subject, but there is advantage in
the change.</p>

<h3>GERMAN WIT AND HUMOR</h3>


<p>Brandt’s <i>Das Narrenschiff</i>, or <i>The Ship of Fools</i>, a long
satirical poem, was published at the close of the Fifteenth century.</p>

<p>It was followed by <i>The Boats of Foolish Women</i> and other
imitative works.</p>

<p>Among them, was <i>The Praise of Folly</i>, by Desiderius Erasmus, a
Dutch classical scholar and satirist.</p>

<p>The following is from the Dedicatory Epistle which introduces <i>The
Praise of Folly</i>, and which is addressed to Sir Thomas More.</p>

<p>“But those who are offended at the lightness and pedantry of this
subject, I would have them consider that I do not set myself for the
first example of this kind, but that the same has been oft done by many
considerable authors. For thus, several ages since, Homer wrote of no
more weighty a subject than of a war between the frogs and mice; Virgil
of a gnat and a pudding cake; and Ovid of a nut. Polycrates commended
the cruelty of Busiris; and Isocrates, that corrects him for this, did
as much for the injustice of Glaucus. Favorinus extolled Thersites,
and wrote in praise of a quartane ague. Synesius pleaded in behalf of
baldness; and Lucian defended a sipping fly. Seneca drollingly related
the deifying of Claudius; Plutarch the dialogue betwixt Gryllus and
Ulysses; Lucian and Apuleius the story of an ass; and somebody else
records the last will of a hog, of which St. Hierom makes mention. So
that, if they please, let themselves think the worst of me, and fancy
to themselves that I was, all this while, a playing at push-pin, or
riding astride on a hobby-horse. For how unjust is it, if when we allow
different recreations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span> to each particular course of life, we afford no
diversion to studies; especially when trifles may be a whet to more
serious thoughts, and comical matters may be so treated of, as that
a reader of ordinary sense may possibly thence reap more advantage
than from some more big and stately argument.... As to what relates
to myself, I must be forced to submit to the judgment of others, yet,
except I am too partial to be judge in my own case, I am apt to believe
I have praised Folly in such a manner as not to have deserved the name
of fool for my pains.”</p>

<p>A short extract from the book follows.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is one farther very commendable property of fools, that
they always speak the truth, than which there is nothing more
noble and heroical. For so, though Plato relates it as a
sentence of Alcibiades, that in the sea of drunkenness truth
swims uppermost, and so wine is the only teller of truth, yet
this character may more justly be assumed by me, as I can make
good from the authority of Euripides, who lays down this as an
axiom, ‘Children and fools always speak the truth.’ Whatever the
fool has in his heart, he betrays in his face; or what is more
notifying, discovers it by his words; while the wise man, as
Euripides observes, carries a double tongue; the one to speak
what may be said, the other what ought to be; the one what
truth, the other what time requires; whereby he can in a trice
so alter his judgment, as to prove that to be now white, which
he had just swore to be black; like the satyr at his porridge,
blowing hot and cold at the same breath; in his lips professing
one thing, when in his heart he means another.</p>

<p>Furthermore, princes in their greatest splendor seem upon this
account unhappy, in that they miss the advantage of being told
the truth, and are shammed off by a parcel of insinuating
courtiers, that acquit themselves as flatterers more than as
friends. But some will perchance object that princes do not love
to hear the truth, and therefore wise men must be very cautious
how they behave themselves before them, lest they should take
too great a liberty in speaking what is true, rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span> than what
is acceptable. This must be confessed, truth indeed is seldom
palatable to the ears of kings, yet fools have so great a
privilege as to have free leave, not only to speak bare truths,
but the most bitter ones too; so as the same reproof which, had
it come from the mouth of a wise man would have cost him his
head, being blurted out by a fool, is not only pardoned, but
well taken, and rewarded. For truth has naturally a mixture of
pleasure, if it carry with it nothing of offence to the person
whom it is applied to; and the happy knack of ordering it so, is
bestowed only on fools....”</p>
</div>

<p>However, but few individual names stand out in the early German
literature that can by any stretch of definition be called humorous.</p>

<p>As in all other countries, legends and folk lore tales were rife, and
eventually produced popular heroes about whom stories were invented.</p>

<p>Brother Rush, who seems to be merely a demon of darkness, is first
found in print in Germany in 1515.</p>

<p>He is a tricksy sprite and goes through various vicissitudes of rather
dull interest.</p>

<p>He was followed by Tyll Eulenspiegel, a far more popular personage, and
translated to England under the name of Owleglas or Howleglas.</p>

<p>Eulenspiegel was a shrewd and cunning proposition and had many
startling adventures, two of which are here given.</p>


<h4><i>EULENSPIEGEL’S PRANKS</i><br />
<span class="subhed"><i>The Golden Horseshoes</i></span></h4>

<p class="p1">Eulenspiegel came to the court of the King of Denmark, who liked him
well, and said that if he would make him some diversion, then might he
have the best of shoes for his horse’s hoofs. Eulenspiegel asked the
king if he was minded to keep his word well and truly, and the king did
answer most solemnly, “Yes.”</p>

<p>Now did Eulenspiegel ride his horse to a goldsmith, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span> whom he
suffered to be beaten upon the horse’s hoofs shoes of gold with silver
nails. This done, Eulenspiegel went to the king, that the king might
send his treasurer to pay for the shoeing. The treasurer believed
he should pay a blacksmith, but Eulenspiegel conducted him to the
goldsmith, who did require and demand one hundred Danish marks. This
would the treasurer not pay, but went and told his master.</p>

<p>Therefore the king caused Eulenspiegel to be summoned into his
presence, and spoke to him:</p>

<p>“Eulenspiegel, why did you have such costly shoes? Were I to shoe all
my horses thus, soon would I be without land or any possessions.”</p>

<p>To which Eulenspiegel did make reply:</p>

<p>“Gracious King, you did promise me the best of shoes for my horse’s
hoofs, and I did think the best were of gold.”</p>

<p>Then the king laughed:</p>

<p>“You shall be of my court, for you act upon my very word.”</p>

<p>And the king commanded his treasurer to pay the hundred marks for the
horse’s golden shoes. But these Eulenspiegel caused to be taken off,
and iron shoes put on in their stead; and he remained many a long day
in the service of the King of Denmark.</p>


<h5><i>Paying with the Sound of a Penny</i></h5>

<p>Eulenspiegel was at a tavern where the host did one day put the meat
on the spit so late that Eulenspiegel got hungry for dinner. The host,
seeing his discontent, said to him:</p>

<p>“Who cannot wait till the dinner be ready, let him eat what he may.”</p>

<p>Therefore Eulenspiegel went aside, and ate some dry bread; after that
he had eaten he sat by the fire and turned the spit until the meat was
roasted. Then was the meat borne upon the table, and the host, with the
guests, did feast upon it. But Eulenspiegel stayed on the bench by the
fire, nor would he sit at the board, since he told the host that he had
his fill from the odor of the meat. So when they had eaten, and the
host came to Eulenspiegel with the tray,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span> that he might place in it the
price of the food, Eulenspiegel did refuse, saying:</p>

<p>“Why must I pay for what I have not eaten?”</p>

<p>To which the host replied, in anger:</p>

<p>“Give me your penny; for by sitting at the fire, and swallowing the
savor of the meat, you had the same nourishment as though you had
partaken of the meat at the board.”</p>

<p>Then Eulenspiegel searched in his purse for a penny, and threw it on
the bench, saying to the host:</p>

<p>“Do you hear this sound?”</p>

<p>“I do, indeed,” answered the host.</p>

<p>Then did Eulenspiegel pick up the penny and restore it to his purse;
which done, he spoke again:</p>

<p>“To my belly the odor of the meat is worth as much as the sound of the
penny is to you.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>About this time came into being the tales of the Schildburgers, or
Noodles, who correspond to the Gothamites of England.</p>

<p>Schildburg, we are told, was a town “in Misnopotamia, beyond Utopia,
in the kingdom of Calecut.” The Schildburgers were originally so
renowned for their wisdom, that they were continually invited into
foreign countries to give their advice, until at length not a man was
left at home, and their wives were obliged to assume the charge of the
duties of their husbands. This became at length so onerous, that the
wives held a council, and resolved on despatching a solemn message in
writing to call the men home. This had the desired effect; all the
Schildburgers returned to their own town, and were so joyfully received
by their wives that they resolved upon leaving it no more. They
accordingly held a council, and it was decided that, having experienced
the great inconvenience of a reputation of wisdom, they would avoid
it in future by assuming the character of fools. One of the first
evil results of their long neglect of home affairs was the want of a
council-hall, and this want they now resolved to supply without delay.
They accordingly went to the hills and woods, cut down the timber,
dragged it with great labour to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span> town, and in due time completed
the erection of a handsome and substantial building. But, when they
entered their new council-hall, what was their consternation to find
themselves in perfect darkness! In fact, they had forgotten to make
any windows. Another council was held, and one who had been among the
wisest in the days of their wisdom, gave his opinion very oracularly;
the result of which was that they should experiment on every possible
expedient for introducing light into the hall, and that they should
first try that which seemed most likely to succeed. They had observed
that the light of day was caused by sunshine, and the plan proposed was
to meet at mid-day when the sun was brightest, and fill sacks, hampers,
jugs, and vessels of all kinds, with sunshine and daylight, which they
proposed afterwards to empty into the unfortunate council-hall. Next
day, as the clock struck one, you might see a crowd of Schildburgers
before the council-house door, busily employed, some holding the sacks
open, and others throwing the light into them with shovels and any
other appropriate implements which came to hand. While they were thus
labouring, a stranger came into the town of Schildburg, and, hearing
what they were about, told them they were labouring to no purpose,
and offered to show them how to get the daylight into the hall. It is
unnecessary to say more than that this new plan was to make an opening
in the roof, and that the Schildburgers witnessed the effect with
astonishment, and were loud in their gratitude to the new comer.</p>

<p>The Schildburgers met with further difficulties before they completed
their council-hall. They sowed a field with salt, and when the
salt-plant grew up next year, after a meeting of the council, at which
it was stiffly disputed whether it ought to be reaped, or mowed, or
gathered in in some other manner, it was finally discovered that
the crop consisted of nothing but nettles. After many accidents of
this kind, the Schildburgers are noticed by the emperor, and obtain
a charter of incorporation and freedom, but they profit little by
it. In trying some experiments to catch mice, they set fire to their
houses, and the whole town is burnt to the ground, upon which, in their
sorrow, they abandon it altogether, and become, like the Jews of old,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
scattered over the world, carrying their own folly into every country
they visit.</p>

<p>Another tale relates how the boors of Schilda contrived to get their
millstone twice down from a high mountain:</p>

<p>The boors of Schilda had built a mill, and with extraordinary labour
they had quarried a millstone for it out of a quarry which lay on
the summit of a high mountain; and when the stone was finished, they
carried it with great labour and pain down the hill. When they had
got to the bottom, it occurred to one of them that they might have
spared themselves the trouble of carrying it down by letting it roll
down. “Verily,” said he, “we are the stupidest of fools to take these
extraordinary pains to do that which we might have done with so little
trouble. We will carry it up, and then let it roll down the hill
by itself, as we did before with the tree which we felled for the
council-house.”</p>

<p>This advice pleased them all, and with greater labour they carried
the stone to the top of the mountain again, and were about to roll it
down, when one of them said, “But how shall we know where it runs to?
Who will be able to tell us aught about it?” “Why,” said the bailiff,
who had advised the stone being carried up again, “this is very easily
managed. One of us must stick in the hole [for the millstone, of
course, had a hole in the middle], and run down with it.” This was
agreed to, and one of them, having been chosen for the purpose, thrust
his head through the hole, and ran down the hill with the millstone.
Now at the bottom of the mountain was a deep fish-pond, into which the
stone rolled, and the simpleton with it, so that the Schildburgers
lost both stone and man, and not one among them knew what had become
of them. And they felt sorely angered against their old companion who
had run down the hill with the stone, for they considered that he had
carried it off for the purpose of disposing of it. So they published a
notice in all the neighbouring boroughs, towns, and villages, calling
on them, that “if any one come there with a millstone round his neck,
they should treat him as one who had stolen the common goods, and give
him to justice.” But the poor fellow lay in the pond, dead. Had he been
able to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span> speak, he would have been willing to tell them not to worry
themselves on his account, for he would give them their own again. But
his load pressed so heavily upon him, and he was so deep in the water,
that he, after drinking water enough&mdash;more, indeed, than was good for
him&mdash;died; and he is dead at the present day, and dead he will, shall,
and must remain!</p>

<p>The earliest known edition of the history of the Schildburgers was
printed in 1597, but the story itself is no doubt older. It will be
seen at once that it involves a satire upon the municipal towns of the
middle ages.</p>


<h3>ITALIAN WIT AND HUMOR</h3>


<p>Of Italian wit and humor up to and through the Sixteenth Century there
is little to be said. Translators who have given us in English the
early literature of Italy have been so concerned with the serious
poetry and prose that they neglected the lighter veins.</p>

<p>If, indeed, there were any worth while.</p>

<p>The outstanding name of the Fourteenth Century is that of Giovanni
Boccaccio.</p>

<p>But though the Decameron, a collection of one hundred stories, is a
mirror of the humorous taste of that time, the stories are for the most
part, long, dull and prosy.</p>

<p>They relate the intrigues of lovers in a freely licentious way, but
both humorous description and witty repartee are consciously lacking.</p>

<p>One of the most amusing of the decent tales is here given, also a
sonnet of Boccaccio’s translated by Rossetti.</p>

<h4><i>THE STOLEN PIG</i></h4>

<p class="p1">Calandrino had a little farm, not far from Florence, which came to him
through his wife. There he used to have a pig fatted every year, and
some time about December he and his wife went always to kill and salt
it for the use of the family. Now it happened once&mdash;she being unwell
at the time&mdash;that he went thither by himself to kill his pig; which
Bruno and Buffalmacco hearing, and knowing she was not to be there,
they went to spend a few days with a great friend of theirs, a priest
in Calandrino’s neighborhood. Now the pig had been killed the very day
they came thither, and Calandrino, seeing them along with the priest,
called to them and said, “Welcome, kindly; I would gladly you should
see what a good manager I am.” Then, taking them into the house, he
showed them this pig. They saw that it was fat, and were told by him
that it was to be salted for his family. “Salted, booby?” said Bruno.
“Sell it, let us make merry with the money, and tell your wife that it
was stolen.” “No,” said Calandrino, “she will never believe it; and,
besides, she would turn me out of doors. Trouble me, then, no further
about any such thing, for I will never do it.” They said a great deal
more to him, but all to no purpose. At length he invited them to
supper, but did it in such a manner that they refused.</p>

<p>After they had come away from him, said Bruno to Buffalmacco, “Suppose
we steal this pig from him to-night.” “How is it possible?” “Oh,
I know well enough how to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span> do it, if he does not remove it in the
meantime from the place where we just now saw it.” “Then let us do it,
and afterward we and the parson will make merry over it.” The priest
assured them that he should like it above all things. “We must use a
little art,” quoth Bruno; “you know how covetous he is, and how freely
he drinks when it is at another’s cost. Let us get him to the tavern,
where the parson shall make a pretense of treating us all, out of
compliment to him. He will soon get drunk, and then the thing will be
easy enough, as there is nobody in the house but himself.”</p>

<p>This was done, and Calandrino, finding that the parson was to pay, took
his glasses pretty freely, and, getting his dose, walked home betimes,
left the door open, thinking that it was shut, and so went to bed.
Buffalmacco and Bruno went from the tavern to sup with the priest, and
as soon as supper was over they took proper tools with them to get into
the house; but finding the door open, they carried off the pig to the
priest’s and went to bed likewise.</p>

<p>In the morning, as soon as Calandrino had slept off his wine, he rose,
came down-stairs, and finding the door open and his pig gone, began to
inquire of everybody if they knew anything of the matter; and receiving
no tidings of it, he made a terrible outcry, saying, “What shall I do
now? Somebody has stolen my pig!” Bruno and Buffalmacco were no sooner
out of bed than they went to his house to hear what he would say;
and the moment he saw them he roared out, “Oh, my friends, my pig is
stolen!” Upon this Bruno whispered to him and said, “Well, I am glad
to see you wise in your life for once.” “Alas!” quoth he, “it is too
true.” “Keep to the same story,” said Bruno, “and make noise enough for
every one to believe you.”</p>

<p>Calandrino now began to bawl louder, “Indeed! I vow and swear to you
that it is stolen.” “That’s right; be sure you let everybody hear you,
that it may appear so.” “Do you think that I would forswear myself
about it? May I be hanged this moment if it is not so!” “How is it
possible!” quoth Bruno; “I saw it but last night; never imagine that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
I can believe it.” “It is so, however,” answered he, “and I am undone.
I dare not now go home again, for my wife will never believe me, and
I shall have no peace this twelve-month.” “It is a most unfortunate
thing,” said Bruno, “if it be true; but you know I put it into your
head to say so last night, and you should not make sport both of your
wife and us at the same time.”</p>

<p>At this Calandrino began to roar out afresh, saying, “Good God! you
make me mad to hear you talk. I tell you once for all it was stolen
this very night!” “Nay, if it be so,” quoth Buffalmacco, “we must think
of some way to get it back again.” “And what way must we take,” said he
“to find it?” “Depend upon it,” replied the other, “that nobody came
from the Indies to steal it; it must be somewhere in your neighborhood,
and if you could get the people together I could make a charm, with
some bread and cheese, that would soon discover the thief.” “True,”
said Bruno, “but they would know in that case what you were about; and
the person that has it would never come near you.” “How must we manage,
then?” said Buffalmacco. “Oh!” replied Bruno, “you shall see me do it
with some pills of ginger and a little wine, which I will ask them to
come and drink. They will have no suspicion what our design is, and we
can make a charm of these as well as of the bread and cheese.” “Very
well,” quoth the other. “What do you say, Calandrino? Have you a mind
we should try it?” “For Heaven’s sake do,” he said; “if I only knew who
the thief is, I should be half comforted.” “Well, then,” quoth Bruno,
“I am ready to go to Florence for the things, if you will only give me
some money.” He happened to have a few florins in his pocket, which he
gave him, and off went Bruno.</p>

<p>When he got to Florence, Bruno went to a friend’s house and bought a
pound of ginger made into pills. He also got two pills made of aloes,
which had a private mark that he should not mistake them, being candied
over with sugar like the rest. Then, having bought a jar of good
wine, he returned to Calandrino, and said, “To-morrow you must take
care to invite every one that you have the least suspicion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span> of; it is
a holiday, and they will be glad to come. We will finish the charm
to-night, and bring the things to your house in the morning, and then I
will take care to do and say on your behalf what is necessary upon such
an occasion.”</p>

<p>Calandrino did as he was told, and in the morning he had nearly all the
people in the parish assembled under an elm-tree in the churchyard. His
two friends produced the pills and wine, and, making the people stand
round in a circle, Bruno said to them, “Gentlemen, it is fit that I
should tell you the reason of your being summoned here in this manner,
to the end, if anything should happen which you do not like, that I
be not blamed for it. You must know, then, that Calandrino had a pig
stolen last night, and, as some of the company here must have taken
it, he, that he may find out the thief, would have every man take and
eat one of these pills, and drink a glass of wine after it. Whoever
the guilty person is, you will find he will not be able to get a bit
of it down, but it will taste so bitter that he will be forced to spit
it out. Therefore, to prevent such open shame, he had better, whoever
he is, make a secret confession to the priest, and I will proceed no
further.”</p>

<p>All present declared their readiness to eat; so, placing them all in
order, he gave every man his pill and coming to Calandrino, he gave one
of the aloe pills to him, which he straightway put into his mouth, and
no sooner did he began to chew it than he was forced to spit it out.
Every one was now attentive to see who spit his pill out, and while
Bruno kept going round, apparently taking no notice of Calandrino, he
heard somebody say behind him, “Hey-day! what is the meaning of its
disagreeing so with Calandrino?” Bruno now turned suddenly about, and
seeing that Calandrino had spit out his pill, he said, “Stay a little,
honest friends, and be not too hasty in judging; it may be something
else that has made him spit, and therefore he shall try another.” So he
gave him the other aloe pill, and then went on to the rest that were
unserved. But if the first was bitter to him, this he thought much
more so. However, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span> endeavored to get it down as well as he could.
But it was impossible; it made the tears run down his cheeks, and he
was forced to spit it out at last, as he had done the other. In the
meantime Buffalmacco was going about with the wine; but when he and all
of them saw what Calandrino had done, they began to bawl out that he
had robbed himself, and some of them abused him roundly.</p>

<p>After they were all gone, Buffalmacco said, “I always thought that you
yourself were the thief, and that you were willing to make us believe
the pig was stolen in order to keep your money in your pocket, lest we
should expect a treat upon the occasion.” Calandrino, who had still the
taste of the aloes in his mouth, fell a-swearing that he knew nothing
of the matter. “Honor bright, now, comrade,” said Buffalmacco, “what
did you get for it?” This made Calandrino quite furious.</p>

<p>To crown all, Bruno struck in: “I was just now told,” said he, “by
one of the company, that you have a mistress in this neighborhood to
whom you are very kind, and that he is confident you have given it to
her. You know you once took us to the plains of Mugnone, to look for
some black stones, when you left us in the lurch, and pretended you
had found them; and now you think to make us believe that your pig is
stolen, when you have either given it away or sold it. You have played
so many tricks upon us, that we intend to be fooled no more by you.
Therefore, as we have had a deal of trouble in the affair, you shall
make us amends by giving us two couple of fowls, unless you mean that
we should tell your wife.”</p>

<p>Calandrino, now perceiving that he would not be believed, and being
unwilling to have them add to his troubles by bringing his wife upon
his back, was forced to give them the fowls, which they joyfully
carried off along with the pork.</p>

<h4><i>THE INHERITANCE OF A LIBRARY</i></h4>

<p class="p1">Jeronimo, who had inherited the place of master and head of the house,
found himself in possession of many thousand florins in ready money.
Wherefore the youth, seeing that he himself had endured no labor and
weariness in gathering together the same, forthwith made up his mind
not to place his affection in possessions of this sort, and at once
began to array himself in sumptuous garments, to taste the pleasures of
the town in the company of certain chosen companions of his, to indulge
in amorous adventures, and in a thousand other ways to dissipate his
substance abroad without restraint of any kind. Not only did he banish
from his mind all thought and design of continuing his studies, but he
even went so far as to harbor against the books, which his father had
held in such high esteem and reverence and had bequeathed to him, the
most fierce and savage hatred.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span> So violent, indeed, was his resentment
against them that he set them down as the worst foes he had in the
world.</p>

<p>On a certain day it happened that the young man, either by accident
or for some reason of his own, betook himself into the library of his
dead father, and there his eye fell upon a vast quantity of handsome
and well-arranged books, such as are wont to be found in places of this
sort. At the first sight of these he was somewhat stricken with fear,
and with a certain apprehension that the spirit of his father might
pursue him; but, having collected his courage somewhat, he turned with
a look of hatred on his face toward the aforesaid books and began to
address them in the following terms:</p>

<p>“Books, books, so long as my father was alive you waged against me war
unceasing, forasmuch as he spent all his time and trouble either in
purchasing you, or in putting you in fair bindings; so that, whenever
it might happen that there came upon me the need of a few florins or
of certain other articles, which all youths find necessary, he would
always refuse to let me have them, saying that it was his will and
pleasure to dispense his money only in the purchase of such books as
might please him. And over and beyond this, he purposed in his mind
that I, altogether against my will, should spend my life in close
companionship with you, and over this matter there arose between us
many times angry and contumelious words. Many times, also, you have put
me in danger of being driven into perpetual exile from this my home.
Therefore it cannot but be pleasing to God&mdash;since it is no fault of
yours that I was not hunted forth from this place&mdash;that I should send
you packing from this my house in such fashion that not a single one
of you will ever behold my door again. And, in sooth, I wonder more
especially that you have not before this disordered my wits, a feat
you might well have accomplished with very little more trouble on your
part, in your desire to do with me as you did with my father, according
to my clear recollection. He, poor man, as if he had become bemused
through conversing with you alone, was accustomed to demean himself
in strange fashion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span> moving his hands and his head in such wise that
over and over again I counted him to be one bereft of reason. Now, on
account of all this, I bid you have a little patience, for the reason
that I have made up my mind to sell you all forthwith, and thus in a
single hour to avenge myself for all the outrages I have suffered on
your account and, over and beyond this, to set myself free from the
possible danger of going mad.”</p>

<p>After he had thus spoken, and had packed up divers volumes of the
aforesaid books&mdash;one of his servants helping him in the work&mdash;he sent
the parcel to the house of a certain lawyer, who was a friend of his,
and then in a very few words came to an agreement with the lawyer as to
the business, the issue of the affair being that, though he had simply
expelled the books from his house, and had not sold them, he received,
nevertheless, on account of the same, several hundred florins. With
these, added to the money which still remained in his purse, he
continued to pursue the course of pleasure he had begun.</p>

<p>This brings us to Benvenuto Cellini, who, though not classed among the
humorists, gives us many flashes of wit and humor in his celebrated
Biography.</p>


<h4><i>A COMPULSORY MARRIAGE AT SWORD’S POINT</i></h4>

<p class="p1">One of those busy personages who delight in spreading mischief came to
inform me that Paolo Micceri had taken a house for his new lady and her
mother, and that he made use of the most injurious and contemptuous
expressions regarding me, to wit:</p>

<p>“Poor Benvenuto! he paid the piper while I danced; and now he goes
about boasting of the exploit. He thinks I am afraid of him&mdash;I, who can
wear a sword and dagger as well as he. But I would have him to know my
weapons are as keen as his. I, too, am a Florentine, and come of the
Micceri, a much better house than the Cellini any time of day.”</p>

<p>In short, the vile informer painted the things in such colors to my
disadvantage that it fired my whole blood. I was in a fever of the most
dangerous kind. And feeling it must kill me unless it found vent, I had
recourse to my usual means on such occasions. I called to my workman,
Chioccia, to accompany me, and told another to follow me with my horse.
On reaching the wretch’s house, finding the door half open, I entered
abruptly in. There he sat with his precious “lady-love,” his boasted
sword and dagger beside him, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span> the very act of jesting with the elder
woman upon my affairs. To slam the door, draw my sword and present the
point to his throat, was the work of a moment, giving him no time to
think of defending himself:</p>

<p>“Vile poltroon, recommend thy soul to God! Thou art a dead man!”</p>

<p>In the excess of his terror he cried out thrice, in a feeble voice,
“Mama! mama! mama! Help, help, help!”</p>

<p>At this ludicrous appeal, so like a girl’s, and the ridiculous manner
in which it was uttered, though I had a mind to kill, I lost half my
rage and could not forbear laughing. Turning to Chioccia, however, I
bade him make fast the door; for I was resolved to inflict the same
punishment upon all three. Still with my sword-point at his throat,
and pricking him a little now and then, I terrified him with the most
desperate threats, and finding that he made no defense, was rather at
a loss how to proceed. It was too poor a revenge&mdash;it was nothing&mdash;when
suddenly it came into my head to make it effectual, and compel him to
espouse the girl upon the spot.</p>

<p>“Up! Off with that ring on thy finger, villain!” I cried. “Marry her
this instant, and then I shall have my full revenge.”</p>

<p>“Anything&mdash;anything you like, provided you will not kill me,” he
eagerly answered.</p>

<p>Removing my sword a little:</p>

<p>“Now, then,” I said, “put on the ring.”</p>

<p>He did so, trembling all the time.</p>

<p>“This is not enough. Go and bring me two notaries to draw up the
contract.” Then, addressing the girl and her mother in French:</p>

<p>“While the notaries and witnesses are coming, I will give you a word of
advice. The first of you that I know to utter a word about my affairs,
I will kill you&mdash;all three. So remember.”</p>

<p>I afterward said in Italian to Paolo:</p>

<p>“If you offer the slightest opposition to the least thing I choose to
propose, I will cut you up into mince-meat with this good sword.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span></p>

<p>“It is enough,” he interrupted in alarm, “that you will not kill me. I
will do whatever you wish.”</p>

<p>So this singular contract was duly drawn out and signed. My rage
and fever were gone. I paid the notaries, and went home.&mdash;<i>The
Biography.</i></p>


<h4><i>CRITICISM OF A STATUE OF HERCULES</i></h4>

<p class="p1">Bandinello was incensed to such a degree that he was ready to burst
with fury, and turning to me said, “What faults have you to find with
my statues?”</p>

<p>I answered, “I will soon tell them, if you have but the patience to
hear me.”</p>

<p>He replied, “Tell them, then.”</p>

<p>The duke and all present listened with the utmost attention. I began
by promising that I was sorry to be obliged to lay before him all
the blemishes of his work, and that I was not so properly delivering
my own sentiments as declaring what was said of it by the artistic
school of Florence. However, as the fellow at one time said something
disobliging, at another made some offensive gesture with his hands or
his feet, he put me into such a passion that I behaved with a rudeness
which I should otherwise have avoided.</p>

<p>“The artistic school of Florence,” said I, “declares what follows:
If the hair of your Hercules were shaved off, there would not remain
skull enough to hold his brains. With regard to his face, it is hard
to distinguish whether it be the face of a man, or that of a creature
something between a lion and an ox; it discovers no attention to what
it is about; and it is so ill set upon the neck, with so little art
and in so ungraceful a manner, that a more shocking piece of work was
never seen. His great brawny shoulders resemble the two pommels of an
ass’s packsaddle. His breasts and their muscles bear no similitude to
those of a man, but seem to have been drawn from a sack of melons.
As he leans directly against the wall, the small of the back has the
appearance of a bag filled with long cucumbers. It is impossible to
conceive in what manner the two legs are fastened to this distorted
figure, for it is hard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span> to distinguish upon which leg he stands, or
upon which he exerts any effort of his strength; nor does he appear to
stand upon both, as he is sometimes represented by those masters of
the art of statuary who know something of their business. It is plain,
too, that the statue inclines more than one-third of a cubit forward;
and this is the greatest and the most insupportable blunder which
pretenders to sculpture can be guilty of. As for the arms, they both
hang down in the most awkward and ungraceful manner imaginable; and so
little art is displayed in them that people would be almost tempted to
think that you had never seen a naked man in your life. The right leg
of Hercules and that of Cacus touch at the middle of their calves, and
if they were to be separated, not one of them only, but both, would
remain without a calf, in the place where they touch. Besides, one of
the feet of the Hercules is quite buried, and the other looks as if it
stood upon hot coals.”&mdash;<i>The Biography.</i></p>


<h3>SPANISH WIT AND HUMOR</h3>

<p>The Spanish literature of this time contains little that can be quoted
as humor.</p>

<p>Hurtado de Mendoza, a novelist, historian and poet, and Lope de Vega,
dramatist, are the principal names among the Spanish writers.</p>

<p>About 1600 there flourished a poet named Baltazar del Alcazar, whose
work shows a rather modern type of humor.</p>

<p>In 1605 was published the first part of <i>Don Quixote de la Mancha</i>

<h4><i>HE SECURES SANCHO PANZA AS HIS SQUIRE</i></h4>

<p class="p1">In the meantime, Don Quixote tampered with a laborer, a neighbor of
his and an honest man (if such an epithet can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span> given to one that is
poor), but shallow-brained; in short, he said so much, used so many
arguments and made so many promises, that the poor fellow resolved to
sally out with him and serve him in the capacity of a squire. Among
other things, Don Quixote told him that he ought to be very glad to
accompany him, for such an adventure might, some time or the other,
occur that by one stroke an island might be won, where he might leave
him governor. With this and other promises, Sancho Panza (for that was
the laborer’s name) left his wife and children and engaged himself as
squire to his neighbor. Don Quixote now set about raising money; and,
by selling one thing, pawning another, and losing by all, he collected
a tolerable sum. He fitted himself likewise with a buckler, which he
borrowed of a friend, and, patching up his broken helmet in the best
manner he could, he acquainted his squire Sancho of the day and hour
he intended to set out, that he might provide himself with what he
thought would be most needful. Above all, he charged him not to forget
a wallet, which Sancho assured him he would not neglect; he said also
that he thought of taking an ass with him, as he had a very good one,
and he was not used to travel much on foot. With regard to the ass,
Don Quixote paused a little, endeavoring to recollect whether any
knight-errant had ever carried a squire mounted on ass-back, but no
instance of the kind occurred to his memory. However, he consented that
he should take his ass, resolving to accommodate him more honorably, at
the earliest opportunity, by dismounting the first discourteous knight
he should meet. He provided himself also with shirts, and other things,
conformably to the advice given him by the innkeeper.</p>

<p>All this being accomplished, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, without
taking leave, the one of his wife and children, or the other of
his housekeeper and niece, one night sallied out of the village
unperceived; and they travelled so hard that by break of day they
believed themselves secure, even if search were made after them. Sancho
Panza proceeded upon his ass like a patriarch, with his wallet and
leathern bottle, and with a vehement desire to find himself governor
of the island which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span> his master had promised him. Don Quixote happened
to take the same route as on his first expedition, over the plain of
Montiel, which he passed with less inconvenience than before; for it
was early in the morning, and the rays of the sun, darting on them
horizontally, did not annoy them. Sancho Panza now said to his master,
“I beseech your worship, good Sir Knight-errant, not to forget your
promise concerning that same island, for I shall know how to govern
it, be it ever so large.” To which Don Quixote answered: “Thou must
know, friend Sancho Panza, that it was a custom much in use among the
knights-errant of old to make their squires governors of the islands or
kingdoms they conquered; and I am determined that so laudable a custom
shall not be lost through my neglect; on the contrary, I resolve to
outdo them in it, for they, sometimes, and perhaps most times, waited
till their squires were grown old; and when they were worn out in
their service, and had endured many bad days and worse nights, they
conferred on them some title, such as count, or at least marquis, of
some valley or province of more or less account; but if you live and
I live, before six days have passed I may probably win such a kingdom
as may have others depending on it, just fit for thee to be crowned
king of one of them. And do not think this any extraordinary matter,
for things fall out to knights by such unforeseen and unexpected ways,
that I may easily give thee more than I promise.” “So, then,” answered
Sancho Panza, “if I were a king, by some of those miracles your worship
mentions, Joan Gutierrez, my duck, would come to be a queen, and my
children infantas!” “Who doubts it?” answered Don Quixote. “I doubt
it,” replied Sancho Panza; “for I am verily persuaded that, if God
were to rain down kingdoms upon the earth, none of them would set well
upon the head of Mary Gutierrez; for you must know, sir, she is not
worth two farthings for a queen. The title of countess would sit better
upon her, with the help of Heaven and good friends.” “Recommend her
to God, Sancho,” answered Don Quixote, “and He will do what is best
for her; but do thou have a care not to debase thy mind so low as to
content thyself with being less than a viceroy.” “Sir, I will not,”
answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span> Sancho; “especially having so great a man for my master as
your worship, who will know how to give me whatever is most fitting for
me and what I am best able to bear.”</p>


<h4><i>OF THE VALOROUS DON QUIXOTE’S SUCCESS IN THE DREADFUL AND
NEVER-BEFORE-IMAGINED ADVENTURE OF THE WINDMILLS</i></h4>

<p class="p1">Engaged in this discourse, they came in sight of thirty or forty
windmills which are in that plain; and as soon as Don Quixote espied
them, he said to his squire, “Fortune disposes our affairs better than
we ourselves could have desired; look yonder, friend Sancho Panza,
where thou mayest discover somewhat more than thirty monstrous giants,
whom I intend to encounter and slay, and with their spoils we will
begin to enrich ourselves; for it is lawful war, and doing God good
service, to remove so wicked a generation from off the face of the
earth.” “What giants?” said Sancho Panza. “Those thou seest yonder,”
answered his master, “with their long arms; for some are wont to have
them almost of the length of two leagues.”</p>

<p>“Look, sir,” answered Sancho, “those which appear yonder are not
giants, but windmills, and what seem to be arms are the sails, which,
whirled about by the wind, make the millstone go.” “It is very
evident,” answered Don Quixote, “that thou art not versed in the
business of adventures. They are giants; and if thou art afraid, get
thee aside and pray, whilst I engage with them in fierce and unequal
combat.” So saying, he clapped spurs to his steed, notwithstanding the
cries his squire sent after him, assuring him that they were certainly
windmills, and not giants. But he was so fully possessed that they were
giants, that he neither heard the outcries of his squire Sancho, nor
yet discerned what they were, though he was very near them, but went
on, crying out aloud, “Fly not, ye cowards and vile caitiffs! for it is
a single knight who assaults you.” The wind now rising a little, the
great sails began to move, upon which Don Quixote called out, “Although
ye should have more arms than the giant Briareus, ye shall pay for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span></p>

<p>Thus recommending himself devoutly to his lady Dulcinea, beseeching
her to succor him in the present danger, being well covered with his
buckler and setting his lance in the rest he rushed on as fast as
Rozinante could gallop and attacked the first mill before him, when,
running his lance into the sail, the wind whirled it about with so
much violence that it broke the lance to shivers, dragging horse and
rider after it, and tumbling them over and over on the plain in very
evil plight. Sancho Panza hastened to his assistance as fast as the ass
could carry him; and when he came up to his master he found him unable
to stir, so violent was the blow which he and Rozinante had received in
their fall.</p>

<p>“God save me!” quoth Sancho, “did not I warn you to have a care of what
you did, for that they were nothing but windmills? And nobody could
mistake them but one that had the like in his head.”</p>

<p>“Peace, friend Sancho,” answered Don Quixote; “for matters of war
are, of all others, most subject to continual change. Now I verily
believe, and it is most certainly the fact, that the sage Freston, who
stole away my chamber and books, has metamorphosed these giants into
windmills, on purpose to deprive me of the glory of vanquishing them,
so great is the enmity he bears me! But his wicked arts will finally
avail but little against the goodness of my sword.”</p>

<p>“God grant it!” answered Sancho Panza. Then, helping him to rise, he
mounted him again upon his steed, which was almost disjointed.&mdash;<i>Don
Quixote.</i></p>


<h3>THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY</h3>

<p>Though still serious-minded in the main, the world at the beginning of
the Seventeenth century recognized and appreciated humor.</p>

<p>And, growing with what it fed upon the vein of humor became more marked
and more important in literature.</p>

<p>Wherefore our outline must from now on be less comprehensive and more
discriminating.</p>

<p>The field is getting too wide, the harvest too bountiful for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span> gleaning,
even for general reaping; we can now only pluck spears of ripened grain.</p>

<p>An Outline can touch only the high spots, and though many wonderful
flashes of wit and humor occur in the works of the most serious writers
space cannot be given to such, it must be conserved for the definitely
and intentionally humorous writers.</p>

<p>This is greatly to be regretted, for not infrequently the jests of the
serious-minded are more intrinsically witty than those of professed
humorists.</p>

<p>As an example may be mentioned George Herbert, the famous clergyman who
was called Holy George Herbert.</p>

<p>His religious writings are interspersed with flashes of exquisite wit.</p>

<p>“God gave thy soul brave wings; put not those feathers Into a bed to
sleep out all ill weathers,”</p>

<p>is a most graceful bit of word play.</p>

<p>And so with scores, even hundreds of worthy writers, among whose pages
brilliant shafts of wit are found.</p>

<p>Such excursions we have no room for, and must abide by the inexorable
laws of limitation.</p>

<p>Nor can such a matter as the Ballads be touched upon.</p>

<p>The historical ballads of this time were narrative poems of exceeding
great length and usually, of exceeding great dulness. Fun they show,
here and there, but the bulk of them are destitute of mirth-provoking
lines.</p>

<p>Not so the Ballad Literature intended for social diversion and lovers
of ribaldry. These, in large numbers, were put forth, and were oftener
than not, founded on the old Jest Books, the Merry Tales, and even the
Gesta and Fabliaux of earlier days.</p>

<p>Collections of these include the effusions of the balladists from the
short stanzas, mere epigrams, to the intolerably long tales based on
political or religious matters.</p>

<p>Yet it is at this juncture we must mention the name of Thomas Hobbes,
the Malmesbury Philosopher, and a most important figure of the
seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Not because of his own wit or humor, but of his understanding and
valuation of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span></p>

<p>His observations on laughter, hereinbefore referred to, must be quoted
entire.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">From Human Nature</span><br />
<span class="subhed"><i>LAUGHTER</i></span></h4>

<p class="p1">There is a passion that hath no name; but the sign of it is that
distortion of the countenance which we call laughter, which is always
joy: but what joy, what we think, and wherein we triumph when we laugh,
is not hitherto declared by any. That it consisteth in wit, or, as they
call it, in the jest, experience confuteth; for men laugh at mischances
and indecencies, wherein there lieth no wit nor jest at all. And
forasmuch as the same thing is no more ridiculous when it groweth stale
or usual, whatsoever it be that moveth laughter, it must be new and
unexpected. Men laugh often&mdash;especially such as are greedy of applause
from everything they do well&mdash;at their own actions performed never so
little beyond their own expectations as also at their own jests: and
in this case it is manifest that the passion of laughter proceedeth
from a sudden conception of some ability in himself that laugheth.
Also, men laugh at the infirmities of others by comparison wherewith
their own abilities are set off and illustrated. Also men laugh at
jests the wit whereof always consisteth in the elegant discovering and
conveying to our minds some absurdity of another; and in this case also
the passion of laughter proceedeth from the sudden imagination of our
own odds and eminency; for what is else the recommending of ourselves
to our own good opinion, by comparison with another man’s infirmity or
absurdity? For when a jest is broken upon ourselves, or friends, of
whose dishonour we participate, we never laugh thereat. I may therefore
conclude that the passion of laughter is nothing else but sudden glory
arising from a sudden conception of some eminency in ourselves, by
comparison with the infirmity of others, or with our own formerly; for
men laugh at the follies of themselves past, when they come suddenly
to remembrance, except they bring with them any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span> present dishonour.
It is no wonder, therefore, that men take heinously to be laughed at
or derided&mdash;that is, triumphed over. Laughing without offence must be
at absurdities and infirmities abstracted from persons, and when all
the company may laugh together; for laughing to one’s self putteth all
the rest into jealousy and examination of themselves. Besides, it is
vain-glory, and an argument of little worth, to think the infirmity of
another sufficient matter for his triumph.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Robert Herrick, among the most exquisite of lyric poets, was a
classical scholar, addicted to Martial. His works, neglected for long
years, came into their own about a century ago, and his spontaneous
gayety and tenderness is not frequently equalled.</p>

<p>The temptation is to quote his lyrics, but his whimsical humor is more
clearly shown in his waggish lines.</p>

<p>John Milton, second only to Shakespeare in all literature, is not
usually looked upon as a humorist.</p>

<p>A wise commentator (of more wisdom than wit), has said, of Milton, “Few
great poets are so utterly without humor; alone among the greatest
poets he has not sung of love.”</p>

<p>We take objection to both these statements, though with the second we
are not now concerned.</p>

<p>Samuel Butler, a brilliant and satiric wit, wrote <i>Hudibras</i>, the
immortal Cavalier burlesque of the views and manners of the English
Puritans. In some degree imitated from <i>Don Quixote</i> as to plan,
this burlesque is so full of shrewd wit and felicitous drollery as to
hold a unique place in literature.</p>

<p>Like all such long works, it is difficult to quote from, but some
passages are given, as well as some of Butler’s clever epigrams.</p>

<p>Samuel Pepys, whose literary work is in Diary form, is no doubt one of
the world’s greatest egoists. But the spontaneity and naturalness of
the account of his daily doings, as told by himself, have a charm all
their own and a unique and inimitable humor.</p>


<h4><i>EXTRACTS FROM THE DIARY</i></h4>

<p class="p1">Rose early, and put six spoons and a porringer of silver in my pocket
to give away to-day. To dinner at Sir William Batten’s; and then, after
a walk in the fine gardens, we went to Mrs. Browne’s, where Sir W. Pen
and I were godfathers, and Mrs. Jordan and Shipman godmothers to her
boy. And there, before and after the christening, we were with the
woman above in her chamber; but whether we carried ourselves well or
ill, I know not; but I was directed by young Mrs. Batten. One passage
of a lady that ate wafers with her dog did a little displease me. I did
give the midwife 10<i>s.</i> and the nurse 5<i>s.</i> and the maid of
the house 2<i>s.</i> But for as much I expected to give the name to the
child, but did not (it being called John), I forbore then to give my
plate.</p>

<p><i>December 26th, 1662.</i>&mdash;Up, my wife to the making of Christmas
pies all day, doeing now pretty well again, and I abroad to several
places about some businesses, among others bought a bake-pan in Newgate
Market, and sent it home, it cost me 16<i>s.</i> So to Dr Williams,
but he is out of town, then to the Wardrobe. Hither come Mr Battersby;
and we falling into discourse of a new book of drollery in use, called
Hudibras, I would needs go find it out, and met with it at the Temple:
cost me 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> But when I come to read it, it is so
silly an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span> abuse of the Presbyter Knight going to the warrs, that I am
ashamed of it; and by and by meeting at Mr Townsend’s at dinner, I sold
it to him for 18<i>d.</i> ...</p>

<p><i>February 6th.</i>&mdash; ... Thence to Lincoln’s Inn Fields; and it being
too soon to go to dinner, I walked up and down, and looked upon the
outside of the new theatre now a-building in Covent Garden, which will
be very fine. And so to a bookseller’s in the Strand, and there bought
Hudibras again, it being certainly some ill-humour to be so against
that which all the world cries up to be the example of wit; for which
I am resolved once more to read him, and see whether I can find it or
no....</p>

<p><i>November 28th.</i>&mdash; ... And thence abroad to Paul’s Churchyard, and
there looked upon the second part of Hudibras, which I buy not, but
borrow to read, to see if it be as good as the first, which the world
cry so mightily up, though it hath not a good liking in me, though I
had tried by twice or three times reading to bring myself to think it
witty. Back again and home to my office....</p>

<p><i>May 11th, 1667.</i>&mdash;And so away with my wife, whose being dressed
this day in fair hair did make me so mad, that I spoke not one word to
her, though I was ready to burst with anger.... After that ... Creed
and I into the Park, and walked, a most pleasant evening, and so took
coach, and took up my wife, and in my way home discovered my trouble
to my wife for her white locks [false hair], swearing by God several
times, which I pray God forgive me for, and bending my fist, that I
would not endure it. She, poor wretch, was surprized with it, and made
me no answer all the way home; but there we parted, and I to the office
late, and then home, and without supper to bed, vexed.</p>

<p><i>12th</i> (Lord’s Day).&mdash;Up and to my chamber, to settle some
accounts there, and by and by down comes my wife to me in her
night-gown, and we begun calmly, that, upon having money to lace her
gown for second mourning, she would promise to wear white locks no more
in my sight, which I, like a severe fool, thinking not enough, began to
except against, and made her fly out to very high terms and cry, and
in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span> heat told me of keeping company with Mrs Knipp, saying, that
if I would promise never to see her more&mdash;of whom she hath more reason
to suspect than I had heretofore of Pembleton&mdash;she would never wear
white locks more. This vexed me, but I restrained myself from saying
anything, but do think never to see this woman&mdash;at least, to have her
here more; but by and by I did give her money to buy lace, and she
promised to wear no more white locks while I lived, and so all very
good friends as ever, and I to my business, and she to dress herself.</p>

<p><i>August 18th</i> (Lord’s Day).&mdash;Up, and being ready, walked up and
down to Cree Church, to see it how it is: but I find no alteration
there, as they say there was, for my Lord Mayor and Aldermen to come
to sermon, as they do every Sunday, as they did formerly to Paul’s....
There dined with me Mr Turner and his daughter Betty. Betty is grown
a fine young lady as to carriage and discourse. I and my wife are
mightily pleased with her. We had a good haunch of venison, powdered
and boiled, and a good dinner and merry.... I walked towards Whitehall,
but, being wearied, turned into St Dunstan’s Church, where I heard an
able sermon of the minister of the place; and stood by a pretty, modest
maid, whom I did labour to take by the hand ...; but she would not,
but got further and further from me; and, at last, I could perceive
her to take pins out of her pocket to prick me if I should touch her
again&mdash;which seeing, I did forbear, and was glad I did spy her design.
And then I fell to gaze upon another pretty maid, in a pew close to
me, and she on me; and I did go about to take her by the hand, which
she suffered a little, and then withdrew. So the sermon ended, and the
church broke up.</p>

by Selvaggi at Rome, which has been thus translated:</p>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Greece boasts her Homer, Rome her Virgil’s name,</div>
        <div>But England’s Milton vies with both in fame.</div>

<p>Cowper’s lines on Milton may be compared with Dryden’s:</p>

    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Ages elapsed ere Homer’s lamp appear’d,</div>

        <div>To carry Nature lengths unknown before,</div>
        <div>To give a Milton birth, ask’d ages more.</div>
        <div>Thus Genius rose and set at order’d times,</div>
        <div>And shot a day-spring into distant climes,</div>
        <div>Ennobling every region that he chose;</div>
        <div>He sunk in Greece, in Italy he rose;</div>
        <div>And, tedious years of gothic darkness pass’d,</div>
        <div>Emerged all splendour in our isle at last,</div>
        <div>Thus lovely halcyons dive into the main,</div>

<p>In Bishop Gibson’s edition of Camden’s <i>Britannia</i>, there is a
very free translation of some old monkish verses on S. Oswald by Basil
Kennet, brother of Bishop White Kennet. The last line, to which there
is nothing corresponding in the Latin, seems to have been copied from
the last line of Dryden’s epigram:</p>

        <div>Great conquests all! but bounteous Heav’n in thee,</div>

<h4><i>FROM ROBINSON CRUSOE</i><br />
<span class="subhed"><i>Friday’s Conflict with the Bear</i></span></h4>

<p class="p1">But never was a fight managed so hardily, and in such a surprising
manner, as that between Friday and the bear, which gave us all&mdash;though
at first we were surprised and afraid for him&mdash;the greatest diversion
imaginable.</p>

<p>My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span> came up to him
he was helping him off from his horse, for the man was both hurt and
frightened, and indeed the last more than the first, when on a sudden
we espied the bear come out of the wood, and a vast, monstrous one it
was, the biggest by far that ever I saw. We were all a little surprised
when we saw him; but when Friday saw him, it was easy to see joy and
courage in the fellow’s countenance. “Oh, oh, oh!” says Friday three
times, pointing to him; “oh, master! you give me te leave, me shakee te
hand with him; me makee you good laugh.”</p>

<p>I was surprised to see the fellow so pleased. “You fool!” said I, “he
will eat you up.” “Eatee me up! eatee me up!” says Friday twice over
again; “me eatee him up; me makee you good laugh; you all stay here,
me show you good laugh.” So down he sits, and gets his boots off in a
moment, and puts on a pair of pumps (as we call the flat shoes they
wear, and which he had in his pocket), gives my other servant his
horse, and with his gun away he flew, swift like the wind.</p>

<p>The bear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle with nobody,
till Friday, coming pretty near, calls to him as if the bear could
understand him, “Hark ye, hark ye,” says Friday, “me speakee with you.”
We followed at a distance, for now, being come down to the Gascony
side of the mountains, we were entered a vast, great forest, where
the country was plain and pretty open, though it had many trees in it
scattered here and there. Friday, who had, as we say, the heels of the
bear, came up with him quickly, and took up a great stone and threw it
at him, and hit him just on the head, but did him no more harm than if
he had thrown it against a wall; but it answered Friday’s end, for the
rogue was so void of fear that he did it purely to make the bear follow
him and show us some laugh, as he called it. As soon as the bear felt
the stone, and saw him, he turns about and comes after him, taking very
long strides, and shuffling on at a strange rate, so as would have put
a horse to a middling gallop. Away runs Friday, and takes his course
as if he ran toward us for help; so we all resolved to fire at once
upon the bear, and deliver my man; though I was angry at him heartily
for bringing the bear back upon us, when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span> was going about his own
business another way; and especially I was angry that he had turned
the bear upon us and then run away; and I called out, “You dog!” said
I, “is this your making us laugh? Come away, and take your horse, that
we may shoot the creature.” He heard me, and cried out, “No shoot! no
shoot! stand still, you get much laugh.” And as the nimble creature
ran two feet for the beast’s one, he turned on a sudden on one side of
us, and seeing a great oak-tree fit for his purpose, he beckoned us to
follow; and doubling his pace, he got nimbly up the tree, laying his
gun down upon the ground, at about five or six yards from the bottom of
the tree.</p>

<p>The bear soon came to the tree, and we followed at a distance. The
first thing he did, he stopped at the gun, smelled at it, but let it
lie, and up he scrambles into the tree, climbing like a cat, though so
monstrous heavy. I was amazed at the folly, as I thought it, of my man,
and could not for my life see anything to laugh at yet, till, seeing
the bear get up the tree, we all rode near to him.</p>

<p>When we came to the tree, there was Friday got out to the small end of
a large limb of the tree, and the bear got about half-way to him. As
soon as the bear got out to that part where the limb of the tree was
weaker, “Ha!” says he to us, “now you see me teachee the bear dance”;
so he began jumping and shaking the bough, at which the bear began to
totter, but stood still, and began to look behind him, to see how he
should get back; then, indeed, we did laugh heartily. But Friday had
not done with him by a great deal. When seeing him stand still, he
called out to him again, as if he had supposed the bear could speak
English, “What, you no come farther? Pray you come farther.” So he
left jumping and shaking the bough; and the bear, just as if he had
understood what he had said, did come a little farther. Then he began
jumping again, and the bear stopped again. We thought now was a good
time to knock him on the head, and called to Friday to stand still, and
we would shoot the bear; but he cried out earnestly, “Oh, pray! oh,
pray! no shoot! me shoot by-and-then.” He would have said by-and-by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span></p>

<p>However, to shorten the story, Friday danced so much, and the bear
stood so ticklish, that we had laughing enough indeed, but still could
not imagine what the fellow would do; for first we thought he depended
upon shaking the bear off; and we found the bear was too cunning for
that too; for he would not go out far enough to be thrown down, but
clung fast with his great broad claws and feet, so that we could not
imagine what would be the end of it, and what the jest would be at
last. But Friday put us out of doubt quickly; for, seeing the bear
cling fast to the bough, and that he would not be persuaded to come any
farther, “Well, well,” says Friday, “you no come farther, me go; you no
come to me, me come to you.” And upon this he went out to the smaller
end of the bough, where it would bend with his weight, and gently let
himself down by it, sliding down the bough till he came near enough
to jump down on his feet, and away he ran to his gun, took it up, and
stood still. “Well,” said I to him, “Friday, what will you do now? Why
don’t you shoot him?” “No shoot,” says Friday, “no yet; me shoot now,
me no kill; me stay, give you one more laugh.” And, indeed, so he did,
as you will see presently. For when the bear saw his enemy gone, he
came back from the bough where he stood, but did it very cautiously,
looking behind him every step, and coming backward till he got into
the body of the tree. Then, with the same hinder end foremost, he came
down the tree, grasping it with his claws, and moving one foot at a
time, very leisurely. At this juncture, and just before he could set
his hind feet upon the ground, Friday stepped up close to him, clapped
the muzzle of his piece into his ear, and shot him dead as a stone.
Then the rogue turned about to see if we did not laugh; and when he saw
we were pleased by our looks, he began to laugh very loud. “So we kill
bear in my country,” says Friday. “So you kill them?” says I; “why, you
have no guns.” “No,” says he, “no gun, but shoot great much long arrow.”</p>

<h3>FRENCH HUMOR</h3>


<p>The first French humorist of note in the seventeenth century was Cyrano
de Bergerac. His History of the Moon and History of the Sun are of the
nature of <i>Gulliver’s Travels</i>.</p>


<h4><i>THE SOUL OF THE CABBAGE</i></h4>

<p class="p1">We laid ourselves along upon very soft quilts, covered with large
carpets; and a young man that waited on us, taking the oldest of our
philosophers led him into a little parlor apart, where my Spirit called
to him to come back to us as soon as he had supped.</p>

<p>This humor of eating separately gave me the curiosity of asking the
cause of it. “He’ll not relish,” said he, “the steam of meat, nor yet
of herbs, unless they die of themselves, because he thinks they are
sensible of pain.” “I wonder not so much,” replied I, “that he abstains
from flesh, and all things that have had a sensitive life. For in our
world the Pythagoreans, and even some holy Anchorites, have followed
that rule; but not to dare, for instance, cut a cabbage, for fear of
hurting it&mdash;that seems to me altogether ridiculous.” “And for my part,”
answered my Spirit, “I find a great deal of reason in his opinion.</p>

<p>“For, tell me is not that cabbage you speak of a being existent in
Nature as well as you? Is not she the common mother of you both? Yet
the opinion that Nature is kinder to mankind than to cabbage-kind,
tickles and makes us laugh. But, seeing she is incapable of passion,
she can neither love nor hate anything; and were she susceptible of
love, she would rather bestow her affection upon this cabbage, which
you grant cannot offend her, than upon that man who would destroy her
if it lay in his power.</p>

<p>“And, moreover, man cannot be born innocent, being a part of the
first offender. But we know very well that the first cabbage did not
offend its Creator. If it be said that we are made after the image
of the Supreme Being, and the cabbage is not&mdash;grant that to be true;
yet by polluting our soul, wherein we resembled Him, we have effaced
that likeness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span> seeing nothing is more contrary to God than sin. If,
then, our soul be no longer His image, we resemble Him no more in our
feet, hands, mouth, forehead, and ears, than a cabbage in its leaves,
flowers, stalk, pith, and head&mdash;do not you really think that if this
poor plant could speak when one cuts it, it would not say, ‘Dear
brother man, what have I done to thee that deserves death? I never
grow but in gardens, and am never to be found in desert places, where
I might live in security; I disdain all other company but thine, and
scarcely am I sowed in thy garden when, to show thee my good-will, I
blossom, stretch out my arms to thee, offer thee my children in grain;
and, as a requital for my civility, thou causest my head to be chopped
off.’ Thus would a cabbage discourse if it could speak.</p>

<p>“To massacre a man is not so great sin as to cut and kill a cabbage,
because one day the man will rise again, but the cabbage has no other
life to hope for. By putting to death a cabbage, you annihilate it;
but in killing a man, you make him only change his habitation. Nay,
I’ll go farther with you still: since God doth equally cherish all His
works, and hath equally, divided the benefits betwixt us and plants, it
is but just we should have an equal esteem for them as for ourselves.
It is true we were born first, but in the family of God there is no
birthright. If, then, the cabbage share not with us in the inheritance
of immortality, without doubt that want was made up by some other
advantage, that may make amends for the shortness of its being&mdash;maybe
by an universal intellect, or a perfect knowledge of all things in
their causes. And it is for that reason that the wise Mover of all
things hath not shaped for it organs like ours, which are proper only
for simple reasoning, not only weak, but often fallacious too; but
others, more ingeniously framed, stronger, and more numerous, which
serve to conduct its speculative exercises. You’ll ask me, perhaps,
whenever any cabbage imparted those lofty conceptions to us? But tell
me, again, who ever discovered to us certain beings, which we allow
to be above us, to whom we bear no analogy nor proportion, and whose
existence it is as hard for us to comprehend as the understanding and
ways<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span> whereby a cabbage expresses itself to its like, though not to us,
because our senses are too dull to penetrate so far?</p>

<p>“Moses, the greatest of philosophers, who drew the knowledge of nature
from the fountain-head, Nature herself, hinted this truth to us when
he spoke of the Tree of Knowledge; and without doubt he intended to
intimate to us under that figure that plants, in exclusion of mankind,
possess perfect philosophy. Remember, then, oh, thou proudest of
animals, that though a cabbage which thou cuttest sayeth not a word,
yet it pays in thinking. But the poor vegetable has no fit organs to
howl as you do, nor yet to frisk about and weep. Yet it hath those
that are proper to complain of the wrong you do it, and to draw a
judgment from Heaven upon you for the injustice. But if you still
demand of me how I come to know that cabbages and coleworts conceive
such pretty thoughts, then will I ask you, how come you to know that
they do not; and how that some among them, when they shut up at
night, may not compliment one another as you do, saying, ‘Good-night,
Master <i>Cole-Curled-Pate</i>! Your most humble servant, good Master
<i>Cabbage-Round-Head</i>!’”</p>

<p>Molière (the stage name of Jean Baptiste Poquelin), the greatest comic
dramatist of France, wrote thirty or more plays. Though difficult to
quote significant passages, two are here given:</p>


<h4><i>FROM “THE LEARNED WOMEN”</i></h4>

<p class="p1"><i>Trissotin.</i> Your verses have beauties unequaled by any others.</p>

<p><i>Vadius.</i> Venus and the graces reign in all yours.</p>

<p><i>Trissotin.</i> You have an easy style, and a fine choice of words.</p>

<p><i>Vadius.</i> In all your writings one finds <i>ithos</i> and
<i>pathos</i>.</p>

<p><i>Trissotin.</i> We have seen some eclogues of your composition which
surpass in sweetness those of Theocritus and Vergil.</p>

<p><i>Vadius.</i> Your odes have a noble, gallant, and tender manner,
which leaves Horace far behind.</p>

<p><i>Trissotin.</i> Is there anything more lovely than your canzonets?</p>

<p><i>Vadius.</i> Is there anything equal to the sonnets you write?</p>

<p><i>Trissotin.</i> Is there anything more charming than your little
rondeaus?</p>

<p><i>Vadius.</i> Anything so full of wit as your madrigals?</p>

<p><i>Trissotin.</i> If France could appreciate your value&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Vadius.</i> If the age could render justice to a lofty genius&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Trissotin.</i> You would ride in the streets in a gilt coach.</p>

<p><i>Vadius.</i> We should see the public erect statues to you. Hem&mdash;It
is a ballad; and I wish you frankly to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Trissotin.</i> Have you heard a certain little sonnet upon the
Princess Urania’s fever?</p>

<p><i>Vadius.</i> Yes; I heard it read yesterday.</p>

<p><i>Trissotin.</i> Do you know the author of it?</p>

<p><i>Vadius.</i> No, I do not; but I know very well that, to tell him the
truth, his sonnet is good for nothing.</p>

<p><i>Trissotin.</i> Yet a great many people think it admirable.</p>

<p><i>Vadius.</i> It does not prevent it from being wretched; and if you
had read it you would think like me.</p>

<p><i>Trissotin.</i> I know that I should differ from you altogether, and
that few people are able to write such a sonnet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span></p>

<p><i>Vadius.</i> Heaven forbid that I should ever write one so bad!</p>

<p><i>Trissotin.</i> I maintain that a better one cannot be made, and my
reason is that I am the author of it.</p>

<p><i>Vadius.</i> You?</p>

<p><i>Trissotin.</i> Myself.</p>

<p><i>Vadius.</i> I cannot understand how the thing could have happened.</p>

<p><i>Trissotin.</i> It is unfortunate that I had not the power of
pleasing you.</p>

<p><i>Vadius.</i> My mind must have wandered during the reading, or else
the reader spoiled the sonnet; but let us leave that subject, and come
to my ballad.</p>

<p><i>Trissotin.</i> The ballad is, to my mind, an insipid thing; it is no
longer the fashion, and savors of ancient times.</p>

<p><i>Vadius.</i> Yet a ballad has charms for many people.</p>

<p><i>Trissotin.</i> It does not prevent me from thinking it unpleasant.</p>

<p><i>Vadius.</i> That does not make it worse.</p>

<p><i>Trissotin.</i> It has wonderful attractions for pedants.</p>

<p><i>Vadius.</i> Yet we see that it does not please you.</p>

<p><i>Trissotin.</i> You stupidly impose your qualities on others.</p>

<p><i>Vadius.</i> You very impertinently cast yours upon me.</p>

<p><i>Trissotin.</i> Go, you little dunce, you pitiful quill-driver!</p>

<p><i>Vadius.</i> Go, you penny-a-liner, you disgrace to the profession!</p>

<p><i>Trissotin.</i> Go, you book-manufacturer, you impudent plagiarist!</p>

<p><i>Vadius.</i> Go, you pedantic snob!</p>

<p><i>Philosopher.</i> Ah! gentlemen, what are you about?</p>

<p><i>Trissotin</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Vadius</span>). Go, go, and make
restitution to the Greeks and Romans for all your shameful thefts!</p>

<p><i>Vadius.</i> Go, and do penance on Parnassus for having murdered
Horace in your verses!</p>

<p><i>Trissotin.</i> Remember your book, and the little stir it made.</p>

<p><i>Vadius.</i> And you, remember your bookseller, reduced to the
workhouse.</p>

<p><i>Trissotin.</i> My fame is established; in vain would you endeavor to
shake it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[396]</span></p>

<p><i>Vadius.</i> Yes, yes; I’ll send you to the author of the
<i>Satires</i>.</p>

<p><i>Trissotin.</i> I, too, will send you to him.</p>

<p><i>Vadius.</i> I have the satisfaction of having been honorably treated
by him; he gives me a passing thrust, and includes me among several
authors well known at court. But you he never leaves in peace; in all
his verses he attacks you.</p>

<p><i>Trissotin.</i> By that we see the honorable rank I hold. He leaves
you in the crowd, and esteems one blow enough to crush you. He has
never done you the honor of repeating his attacks, whereas he assails
me separately, as a noble adversary against whom all his efforts are
necessary. His blows, repeated against me on all occasions, show that
he never thinks himself victorious.</p>

<p><i>Vadius.</i> My pen will teach you what soft of man I am!</p>

<p><i>Trissotin.</i> And mine will make you know your master!</p>

<p><i>Vadius.</i> I defy you in verse, prose, Greek, and Latin!</p>

<p><i>Trissotin.</i> Very well, we shall meet again at the bookseller’s!</p>


<h4><i>FROM “THE GENTLEMAN CIT”</i></h4>

<p class="p1"><i>Professor of Philosophy.</i> I will thoroughly explain all these
curiosities to you.</p>

<p><i>M. Jourdain.</i> Pray do. And now I want to entrust you with a great
secret. I am in love with a lady of quality, and I should be glad if
you would help me to write something to her in a short letter which I
mean to drop at her feet.</p>

<p><i>Professor of Philosophy.</i> Very well.</p>

<p><i>M. Jourdain.</i> That will be gallant, will it not?</p>

<p><i>Professor of Philosophy.</i> Undoubtedly. Is it verse you wish to
write to her?</p>

<p><i>M. Jourdain.</i> Oh, no, not verse.</p>

<p><i>Professor of Philosophy.</i> You only wish for prose?</p>

<p><i>M. Jourdain.</i> No, I wish neither verse nor prose.</p>

<p><i>Professor of Philosophy.</i> It must be one or the other.</p>

<p><i>M. Jourdain.</i> Why?</p>

<p><i>Professor of Philosophy.</i> Because, sir, there is nothing by which
we can express ourselves except prose or verse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[397]</span></p>

<p><i>M. Jourdain.</i> There is nothing but prose or verse?</p>

<p><i>Professor of Philosophy.</i> No, sir. Whatever is not prose is
verse, and whatever is not verse is prose.</p>

<p><i>M. Jourdain.</i> And when we speak, what is that, then?</p>

<p><i>Professor of Philosophy.</i> Prose.</p>

<p><i>M. Jourdain.</i> What! when I say, “Nicole, bring me my slippers,
and give me my night-cap,” is that prose?</p>

<p><i>Professor of Philosophy.</i> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>M. Jourdain.</i> Upon my word, I have been talking prose these forty
years without being aware of it! I am under the greatest obligation to
you for informing me. Well, then, I wish to write to her in a letter,
<i>Fair marchioness, your beautiful eyes make me die of love!</i> but I
would have this worded in a genteel manner, and turned prettily.</p>

<p><i>Professor of Philosophy.</i> Say that the fire of her eyes has
reduced your heart to ashes; that you suffer day and night for her
tortures&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>M. Jourdain.</i> No, no, no; I don’t want any of that. I simply wish
to say what I tell you: <i>Fair marchioness, your beautiful eyes make
me die of love</i>.</p>

<p><i>Professor of Philosophy.</i> Still, you might amplify the thing a
little?</p>

<p><i>M. Jourdain.</i> No, I tell you, I will have nothing but those very
words in the letter; but they must be put in a fashionable way, and
arranged as they should be. Pray explain a little, so that I may see
the different ways in which they can be put.</p>

<p><i>Professor of Philosophy.</i> They may be put, first of all, as
you have said, <i>Fair marchioness, your beautiful eyes make me die
of love</i>; or else, <i>Of love die make me, fair marchioness, your
beautiful eyes</i>; or, <i>Your beautiful eyes of love make me, fair
marchioness, die</i>; or, <i>Die of love your beautiful eyes, fair
marchioness, make me</i>; or else, <i>Me make your beautiful eyes die,
fair marchioness, of love</i>.</p>

<p><i>M. Jourdain.</i> But of all these ways, which is the best?</p>

<p><i>Professor of Philosophy.</i> The one you said&mdash;<i>Fair marchioness,
your beautiful eyes make me die of love</i>.</p>

<p><i>M. Jourdain.</i> Yet I have never studied, and I did all that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[398]</span> right
off at the first shot. I thank you with all my heart, and I beg you to
come early again to-morrow morning.</p>

<p><i>Professor of Philosophy.</i>&mdash;I shall not fail you.</p>

<h4><i>FROM LES PROVINCIALES</i><br />
<span class="subhed"><i>ON MENTAL RESERVATIONS</i></span></h4>

<p class="p1">“I proceed to the facilities we have invented for the avoidance of
sin in the conversation and intrigues of the world. One of the most
embarrassing things to provide against is <i>lying</i>, when it is
the object to excite confidence in any false representation. In this
case, our doctrine of <i>equivocals</i> is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[401]</span> of admirable service, by
which, says Sanchez, ‘it is lawful to use ambiguous terms to give the
impression a different sense from that which you understand yourself.’”
“This I am well aware of, father.” “We have,” continued he, “published
it so frequently, that in fact every body is acquainted with it; but
pray, do you know what is to be done when no equivocal terms can be
found?” “No, father.” “Ha, I thought this would be new to you: it is
the doctrine of <i>mental reservations</i>. Sanchez states it in the
same place: ‘A person may take an oath that he has not done such a
thing, though in fact he has, by saying to himself, it was not done
on a certain specified day or before he was born, or by concealing
any other similar circumstance which gives another meaning to the
statement. This is in numberless instances extremely convenient, and
is always justifiable when it is necessary to your welfare, honor, or
property.’”</p>

<p>“But, father, is not this adding perjury to lying?” “No; Sanchez and
Filiutius show the contrary: ‘It is the <i>intention</i> which stamps
the quality of the action’; and the latter furnishes another and surer
method of avoiding lying. After saying in an audible voice, <i>I swear
that I did not do this</i>, you may add inwardly, <i>to-day</i>; or
after affirming aloud, <i>I swear</i> you may repeat in a whisper, <i>I
say</i>; and then resuming the former tone&mdash;<i>I did not do it</i>.
Now this you must admit is telling the truth.” “I own it is,” said I;
“but it is telling truth in a whisper, and a lie in an audible voice;
besides, I apprehend that very few people have sufficient presence of
mind to avail themselves of this deception.” “Our fathers,” answered
the Jesuit, “have in the same place given directions for those who do
not know how to manage these niceties, so that they may be indemnified
against the sin of lying, while plainly declaring they have not done
what in reality they have, provided ‘that, in general, they intended to
give the same sense to their assertion which a skilful man would have
contrived to do.’”</p>

<p>“Now confess,” he asked, “have not you sometimes been embarrassed
through an ignorance of this doctrine?” “Certainly.” “And will you
not admit, too, that it would often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[402]</span> be very convenient to violate
your word with a good conscience?” “Surely, one of the most convenient
things in the world!” “Then, sir, listen to Escobar; he gives this
general rule: ‘Promises are not obligatory when a man has no intention
of being bound to fulfil them; and it seldom happens that he has such
an intention, unless he confirms it by an oath or bond, so that when
he merely says <i>I will do it</i>, it is to be understood <i>if he do
not change his mind</i>; for he did not intend by what he promised to
deprive himself of his liberty.’ He furnishes some other rules which
you may read for yourself, and concludes thus: ‘Everything is taken
from Molina and our other authors&mdash;<i>omnia ex Molina et aliis’</i>; it
is, consequently, indisputable.”</p>

<p>“Father,” exclaimed I, “I never knew before that the direction of the
intention could nullify the obligation of a promise.” “Now, then,”
said he, “you perceive this very much facilitates the intercourse of
mankind.”</p>

<p>Alan René Le Sage, novelist and dramatist, is best known for his
celebrated work, <i>Gil Blas</i>. He also wrote many farce-operettas,
which offer no opportunity for quotation.</p>

<h4><i>IPHIS</i></h4>

<p class="p1">Iphis at church sees a new-fashioned shoe; he looks upon his own and
blushes, and can no longer believe himself dressed. He came to prayers
only to show himself, and now he hides himself. The foot keeps him in
his room the rest of the day. He has a soft hand, with which he gives
you a gentle pat. He is sure to laugh often to show his white teeth.
He strains his mouth to a perpetual smile. He looks upon his legs, he
views himself in the glass, and nobody can have so good an opinion of
another as he has of himself. He has acquired a delicate and clear
voice, and has a happy manner in talking. He has a turn of the head, a
sweetness in his glance that he never fails to make use of. His gait is
slow, and the prettiest he is able to contrive. He sometimes employs a
little rouge, but seldom; he will not make a habit of it. It is true
that he wears breeches and a hat, has neither earrings nor necklace,
therefore I have not put him in the chapter on woman.</p>


<h4><i>THOUGHTS</i></h4>

<p class="p1">The pleasure of criticizing robs us of the pleasure of unconscious
delight.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The most accomplished work of the age would fail under the hands
of censors and critics, if the author would listen to all their
objections, and allow each one to throw out the passage that had
pleased him least.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This good we get from the perfidiousness of woman, that it cures us of
jealousy.</p>

<p>There are but two ways of rising in the world&mdash;by your own industry, or
by the weakness of others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[407]</span></p>

<p>If life is miserable, it is painful to live; if happy, it is terrible
to die; both come to the same thing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is nothing men are so anxious to preserve, or so careless about,
as life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We are afraid of old age, and afraid not to attain it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If some men died, and others did not, death would indeed be a terrible
affliction.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are but three events that happen to men&mdash;birth, life, and death.
They know nothing of their birth, suffer when they die, and forget to
live.</p>

<h3>GERMAN HUMOR</h3>


<p>Germany in the seventeenth century wakes up to a dim and dawning
humorous sense, but gives little definite expression to it, unless we
except Abraham á Sancta Clara, an Augustinian monk and satirical writer
of repute.</p>


<h4><i>THE DONKEY’S VOICE</i></h4>

<p class="p1">A certain singer was most vain of his voice, thinking it so enchanting
it might allure the very dolphins, or if not them, the pike, from out
of the deep. But it is an old custom of the Lord to punish the vain
ones of the earth, who like nothing better than praise. So the Lord
made this man sing false at Holy Mass, and the whole congregation was
utterly displeased. Close by the altar there was kneeling an old woman,
who wept bitterly during the Mass. The conceited songster, thinking
that the old woman had been moved to those tears by the sweetness of
his voice, after Mass approached the dame, asking her, in the presence
of the congregation, why she had wept so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[413]</span> sadly. His mouth watered
for the expected praise, when, “Sir,” said the woman, “while you were
singing I remembered my donkey; I lost him, poor soul three days ago,
and his voice was very natural, like yours. Oh, heavenly Father, if I
could only find that good and useful beast!”</p>

<h4><i>A BURDENSOME WIFE</i></h4>

<p class="p1">A man set sail from Venice for Ancona, with his wife, both being minded
to offer their devotions at the shrine of Santa Maria di Loreto. But
during the voyage there arose such a great storm that all thought the
ship in extreme peril of sinking. The owner of the ship therefore
gave his command that each traveler should forthwith throw his most
burdensome possessions into the sea, so that the vessel might be made
lighter. Some rolled casks of wine overboard, and others bales of
cloth; the man from Venice, who did not desire to be found tarrying
behind the rest, seized his wife, exclaiming, “Forgive me, Ursula
mine, but this day you must drink to my health in salt water!” and
would throw her into the sea. The frightened wife making a commotion
with her screams, others ran up, and scolded the husband, asking him
the cause of his action. “The owner of the ship,” said he, “urgently
commanded that we all should throw overboard our heaviest burdens. Now,
throughout my whole life nothing has ever been so burdensome to me
as this woman; hence I was gladly willing to make her over to Father
Neptune.”</p>

<h3>THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY</h3>

<p>Jonathan Swift, the famous author of <i>Gulliver’s Travels</i>, wrote
voluminously. His wit was rather heavy, his satire stinging.</p>

<p>It is unsatisfactory to quote from his longer works, but examples of
his lighter vein are offered.</p>


<h4><i>AGAINST ABOLISHING CHRISTIANITY</i></h4>

<p class="p1">Another advantage proposed by the abolishing of Christianity is the
clear gain of one day in seven, which is now entirely lost, and
consequently the kingdom one-seventh less considerable in trade,
business, and pleasure; besides the loss to the public of so many
stately structures now in the hands of the clergy, which might
be converted into play-houses, exchanges, market-houses, common
dormitories, and other public edifices.</p>

<p>I hope I shall be forgiven a hard word if I call this a perfect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[416]</span> cavil.
I readily own there hath been an old custom, time out of mind, for
people to assemble in the churches every Sunday, and that shops are
still frequently shut, in order, as it is conceived, to preserve the
memory of that ancient practice; but how this can prove a hindrance to
business or pleasure is hard to imagine. What if the men of pleasure
are forced, one day in the week, to game at home instead of the
chocolate-house? Are not the taverns and coffee-houses open? Can there
be a more convenient season for taking a dose of physic? Is not that
the chief day for traders to sum up the accounts of the week, and for
lawyers to prepare their briefs? But I would fain know how it can be
pretended that the churches are misapplied? Where are more appointments
and rendezvouses of gallantry? Where more care to appear in the
foremost box, with greater advantage of dress? Where more meetings for
business? Where more bargains driven of all sorts? And where so many
conveniences or incitements to sleep?...</p>

<p>It may perhaps admit a controversy, whether the banishing all notions
of religion whatsoever would be inconvenient for the vulgar. Not that
I am in the least of opinion, with those who hold religion to have
been the invention of politicians, to keep the lower part of the world
in awe by the fear of invisible powers, unless mankind were then very
different from what it is now; for I look upon the mass or body of
our people here in England to be as Freethinkers&mdash;that is to say, as
staunch unbelievers&mdash;as any of the highest rank. But I conceive some
scattered notions about a superior Power to be of singular use for the
common people, as furnishing excellent materials to keep children quiet
when they grow peevish, and providing topics of amusement in a tedious
winter night.</p>

<p>John Arbuthnot, celebrated both as a physician and a man of letters,
leaves us this bit of nonsense.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">John Arbuthnot</span><br />
<span class="subhed"><i>A DISSERTATION ON DUMPLINGS</i></span></h4>

<p class="p1">The dumpling is, indeed, an ancient institution and of foreign origin;
but, alas! what were those dumplings? Nothing but a few lentils sodden
together, moistened and cemented with a little seethed fat, not much
unlike our grit or oatmeal pudding; yet were they of such esteem among
the ancient Romans, that a statue was erected to Fulvius Agricola, the
first inventor of these lentil dumplings. How unlike the gratitude
shown by the public to our modern projectors!</p>

<p>The Romans, though our conquerors, found themselves much outdone in
dumplings by our forefathers, the Roman dumplings being no more to
compare to those made by the Britons than a stone-dumpling is to a
marrow-pudding; though, indeed, the British dumpling at that time was
little better than what we call a stone-dumpling, nothing else but
flour and water. But every generation growing wiser and wiser, the
project was improved, and dumpling grew to be pudding. One projector
found milk better than water; another introduced butter; some added
marrow, others plums; and some found out the use of sugar; so that, to
speak truth, we know not where to fix the genealogy or chronology of
any of these pudding projectors; to the reproach of our historians,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[428]</span>
who ate so much pudding, yet have been so ungrateful to the first
professors of this most noble science as not to find them a place in
history....</p>

<p>The invention of eggs was merely accidental, two or three of which
having casually rolled from a shelf into the pudding which a goodwife
was making, she found herself under the necessity either of throwing
away her pudding or letting the eggs remain. But concluding, from the
innocent quality of the eggs, that they would do no hurt, if they did
no good, she wisely jumbled them all together, after having carefully
picked out the shells. The consequence is easily imagined: the pudding
became a pudding of puddings, and the use of eggs from thence took its
date. The woman was sent for to Court to make puddings for King John,
who then swayed the scepter, and gained such favour that she was the
making of the whole family.</p>

<p>I cannot conclude this paragraph without owning I received this
important part of the history of pudding from Mr. Lawrence, of
Wilson-Green, the greatest antiquary of the present age....</p>

<p>From that time the English became so famous for puddings, that they are
called pudding-eaters all over the world to this day.</p>

<p>At her demise, the woman’s son was taken into favour, and made the
King’s chief cook; and so great was his fame for puddings, that he was
called Jack Pudding all over the kingdom, though, indeed, his real name
was John Brand, as by the records of the kitchen you will find. This
Jack Pudding became yet a greater favourite than his mother, insomuch
that he had the King’s ear as well as his mouth at command, for the
King, you must know, was a mighty lover of pudding. It is needless to
enumerate the many sorts of pudding he made. He made every pudding
except quaking pudding, which was solely invented by our friends of the
<i>Bull and Mouth</i>.</p>

<p>Lord Chesterfield, best known for his <i>Letters to his Son</i>, showed

<p>Men who converse only with women are frivolous, effeminate puppies, and

<p>The desire of being pleased is universal. The desire of pleasing should
be so too. Misers are not so much blamed for being misers as envied for
being rich.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Dissimulation to a certain degree is as necessary in business as
clothes are in the common intercourse of life; and a man would be as
imprudent who should exhibit his inside naked, as he would be indecent
if he produced his outside so.</p>

<p>Hymen comes whenever he is called, but Love only when he pleases.</p>

<p>A woman will be implicitly governed by the man whom she is in love
with, but will not be directed by the man whom she esteems the most.
The former is the result of passion, which is her character; the latter
must be the effect of reasoning, which is by no means of the feminine
gender.</p>

<p>Of the writers who come next, chronologically, Fielding, Sterne,
Garrick, Smollett, Foote, and others of lesser degree, we can quote no
extracts, owing to the continuous character of their work.</p>

<p>At this time, humor was broad and wit coarse, yet the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[430]</span> plays and novels
of the period have lasted and retained their reputation.</p>

<p>Which brings us to Samuel Johnson.</p>

<p>Doctor Johnson’s wit was ponderous, but as his is one of the greatest
names in Eighteenth Century literature, we give a bit from <i>The
Idler</i> which is not entirely inappropriate to the present day.</p>


<h4><i>ON LYING NEWS-WRITERS</i></h4>

<p class="p1">No species of literary men has lately been so much multiplied as the
writers of news. Not many years ago the nation was content with one
gazette; but now we have not only in the metropolis papers for every
morning and every evening, but almost every large town has its weekly
historian, who regularly circulates his periodical intelligence, and
fills the villages of his district with conjectures on the events of
war, and with debates on the true interest of Europe.</p>

<p>To write news in its perfection requires such a combination of
qualities, that a man completely fitted for the task is not always to
be found. In Sir Henry Wotton’s jocular definition, “An ambassador is
said to be a man of virtue sent abroad to tell lies for the advantage
of his country; a news-writer is a man without virtue, who writes lies
at home for his own profit.” To these compositions is required neither
genius nor knowledge, neither industry nor sprightliness; but contempt
of shame and indifference to truth are absolutely necessary. He who
by a long familiarity with infamy has obtained these qualities, may
confidently tell to-day what he intends to contradict to-morrow; he may
affirm fearlessly what he knows that he shall be obliged to recant, and
may write letters from Amsterdam or Dresden to himself.</p>

<p>In a time of war the nation is always of one mind, eager to hear
something good of themselves and ill of the enemy. At this time the
task of news-writers is easy; they have nothing to do but to tell that
a battle is expected, and afterward that a battle has been fought, in
which we and our friends, whether conquering or conquered, did all, and
our enemies did nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[431]</span></p>

<p>Scarcely anything awakens attention like a tale of cruelty. The writer
of news never fails in the intermission of action to tell how the
enemies murdered children and ravished virgins; and, if the scene of
action be somewhat distant, scalps half the inhabitants of a province.</p>

<p>Among the calamities of war may be justly numbered the diminution
of the love of truth, by the falsehoods which interest dictates and
credulity encourages. A peace will equally leave the warrior and
relater of wars destitute of employment; and I know not whether more
is to be dreaded from the streets filled with soldiers accustomed to
plunder, or from garrets filled with scribblers accustomed to lie.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Also, lapsing into sheer nonsense verse, Doctor Johnson has left for
our delectation these delightful rhymes.</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>As with my hat upon my head</div>
        <div class="i1">I walked along the Strand,</div>

        <div class="i1">With his hat in his hand.</div>

     <div class="stanza">

        <div class="i1">But still the child squealed on.</div>

        <div>If a man who turnips cries,</div>
        <div>Cry not when his father dies,</div>

        <div>Have a turnip than a father.</div>
      </div>

<p>Oliver Goldsmith, humorous writer of plays and novels, left many world
famous books.</p>

<p>His rhymes are often of the nonsense variety, and, as was common in his
day, abounded in puns, or punning ideas.</p>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Close by the threshold of a door nailed fast,</div>
        <div>Three kittens sat; each kitten looked aghast.</div>

        <div>Not much concerned to know what they did there;</div>
        <div>Not deeming kittens worth a poet’s care.</div>
        <div>But presently, a loud and furious hiss</div>
        <div>Caused me to stop, and to exclaim, “What’s this</div>
        <div>When lo! upon the threshold met my view,</div>
        <div>With head erect, and eyes of fiery hue,</div>
        <div>A viper long as Count de Grasse’s queue.</div>
        <div>Forth from his head his forked tongue he throws,</div>
        <div>Darting it full against a kitten’s nose;</div>
        <div>Who, having never seen, in field or house,</div>
        <div>The like, sat still and silent as a mouse;</div>
        <div>Only projecting, with attention due,</div>
        <div>Her whiskered face, she asked him, “Who are you?”</div>
        <div>On to the hall went I, with pace not slow,</div>
        <div>But swift as lightning, for a long Dutch hoe:</div>
        <div>With which well armed, I hastened to the spot</div>
        <div>To find the viper&mdash;but I found him not.</div>
        <div>And, turning up the leaves and shrubs around,</div>
        <div>Found only that he was not to be found;</div>
        <div>But still the kittens, sitting as before,</div>
        <div>Sat watching close the bottom of the door.</div>
        <div>“I hope,” said I, “the villain I would kill</div>
        <div>Has slipped between the door and the door-sill;</div>
        <div>And if I make despatch, and follow hard,</div>
        <div>No doubt but I shall find him in the yard”:</div>
        <div>(For long ere now it should have been rehearsed,</div>
        <div>’Twas in the garden that I found him first.)</div>
        <div>E’en there I found him: there the full-grown cat</div>
        <div>His head, with velvet paw, did gently pat;</div>
        <div>As curious as the kittens erst had been</div>
        <div>To learn what this phenomenon might mean.</div>
        <div>Filled with heroic ardour at the sight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[437]</span></div>
        <div>And fearing every moment he would bite,</div>
        <div>And rob our household of our only cat</div>
        <div>That was of age to combat with a rat;</div>
        <div>With outstretched hoe I slew him at the door</div>
        <div>And taught him never to come there no more!</div>

<p>George Colman, the Younger, best known as a comic dramatist, also wrote
many poetical travesties, which he published under various titles,
including the well known one of Broad Grins. These compositions show a
broad humor, not always in the best taste.</p>

<p>George Canning, among other amusements, chose to ridicule<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[439]</span> the Sapphic
rhymes of Southey, and wrote this burlesque upon the humanitarian
sentiments of Southey in his younger days, as well as of the Sapphic
stanzas in which he sometimes embodied them.</p>

<p>Robert Burns, one of the chief names in Scottish literature, has been
called the Dictionary of Poetical Quotations.</p>

<p>Byron said, “The rank of Burns is the very first of his art”; and the
many-sided Scotchman had both admirers and detractors galore.</p>

<p>It has been noted that the Scotch have a sense of humor, “because
it is a gift.” Burns’ sense of humor secures for him a high place
among humorists, and though coarse in his expressions, he is not
intentionally vulgar.</p>

    <h4><i>HOLY WILLIE’S PRAYER</i></h4>

<p class="p1 sm">Holy Willie was a small farmer, leading elder to Dr. Auld, austere in
speech, scrupulous to all outward appearances, a professing Christian.
He experienced, however, “a sore fall”; he was “found out” to be a
hypocrite after Burns’ castigation, and was expelled the church for
embezzling the money of the poor of the parish. His name was William
Fisher.</p>

<h3>THE NINETEENTH CENTURY</h3>

<p>Quite lately, a well known humorist of the present day was making
an after dinner speech. A voice from the audience called out,
“Louder!&mdash;and funnier!”</p>

<p>Some such voice must have called out to the World’s Humor at the close
of the Eighteenth Century, for the beginning of the Nineteenth finds
the Humorous element in literature decidedly louder and funnier.</p>

<p>The Romantic Revival which at this time affected all literature and art
has been called both the effect and the cause of the French Revolution.</p>

<p>It has also been called the Renascence of Wonder, and as such it let
loose hitherto hidebound fancies and imaginations on boundless and
limitless flights. In these flights Humor showed speed and endurance
quite equal to those of Romance or Poesy.</p>

<p>Both in energy and methods, Humor came to the front with tremendous
strides. In quality and quantity it forged ahead, both as a component
part of more serious writings and also independently.</p>

<p>And while this was a consummation devoutly to be wished, it makes
harder the task of the Outliner.</p>

<p>Many great writers held to the conviction that in Romantic poetry humor
has no place. Others were avowed comic writers of verse or prose. But
others still allowed humor to meet and mingle with their numbers, to a
greater or less degree.</p>

<p>And the difficulty of selection lies in the fact that the incidental
humor is often funnier than the entirely humorous concept.</p>

<p>It is hard to omit such as Jane Austen, Sir Walter Scott, William
Wordsworth, yet quotations from their works, showing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[446]</span> their humorous
vein, would occupy space demanded by the humorists themselves.</p>

<p>So, let us start in boldly with Sydney Smith, one of the most popular
wits of all ages.</p>

<p>Aside from this author’s epigrams and witty sayings, he wrote with
great wisdom and insight about the principles of humor itself, from
which we quote his sapient remarks on punning.</p>

<p>“It is imagined that wit is a sort of inexplicable visitation, that
it comes and goes with the rapidity of lightning, and that it is
quite as unattainable as beauty or just proportion. I am so much of a
contrary way of thinking, that I am convinced a man might sit down as
systematically and as successfully, to the study of wit as he might to
the study of mathematics; and I would answer for it that by giving up
only six hours a day to being witty, he should come on prodigiously
before midsummer, so that his friends should hardly know him again.
For what is there to hinder the mind from gradually acquiring a habit
of attending to the lighter relations of ideas in which wit consists?
Punning grows upon everybody, and punning is the wit of words. I do not
mean to say that it is so easy to acquire a habit of discovering new
relations in <i>ideas</i> as in <i>words</i>, but the difficulty is
not so much greater as to render it insuperable to habit. One man is
unquestionably much better calculated for it by nature than another;
but association, which gradually makes a bad speaker a good one, might
give a man wit who had it not, if any man chose to be so absurd as to
sit down to acquire it.</p>

<p>“I have mentioned puns. They are, I believe, what I have denominated
them&mdash;the wit of words. They are exactly the same to words which wit
is to ideas, and consist in the sudden discovery of relations in
language. A pun, to be perfect in its kind, should contain two distinct
meanings; the one common and obvious, the other more remote; and in
the notice which the mind takes of the relation between these two
sets of words, and in the surprise which that relation excites, the
pleasure of a pun consists. Miss Hamilton, in her book on Education,
mentions the instance of a boy so very neglectful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[447]</span> that he could never
be brought to read the word <i>patriarchs</i>; but whenever he met with
it he always pronounced it <i>partridges</i>. A friend of the writer
observed to her that it could hardly be considered as a mere piece
of negligence, for it appeared to him that the boy, in calling them
partridges, was <i>making game</i> of the patriarchs. Now here are
two distinct meanings contained in the same phrase: for to make game
of the patriarchs is to laugh at them; or to make game of them is by
a very extravagant and laughable sort of ignorance of words, to rank
them among pheasants, partridges, and other such delicacies, which the
law takes under its protection and calls game: and the whole pleasure
derived from this pun consists in the sudden discovery that two such
different meanings are referable to one form of expression. I have very
little to say about puns; they are in very bad repute, and so they
ought to be. The wit of language is so miserably inferior to the wit of
ideas that it is very deservedly driven out of good company. Sometimes,
indeed, a pun makes its appearance which seems for a moment to redeem
its species; but we must not be deceived by them: it is a radically
bad race of wit. By unremitting persecution, it has been at last got
under, and driven into cloisters&mdash;from whence it must never again be
suffered to emerge into the light of the world. One invaluable blessing
produced by the banishment of punning is an immediate reduction of the
number of wits. It is a wit of so low an order, and in which some sort
of progress is so easily made, that the number of those endowed with
the gift of wit would be nearly equal to those endowed with the gift of
speech. The condition of putting together ideas in order to be witty
operates much in the same salutary manner as the condition of finding
rhymes in poetry;&mdash;it reduces the number of performers to those who
have vigour enough to overcome incipient difficulties, and make a sort
of provision that that which need not be done at all should be done
<i>well</i> whenever it <i>is</i> done.”</p>

<p>This quotation from one of Sydney Smith’s Speeches is characteristic of
his style.</p>

<h4><i>MRS. PARTINGTON</i></h4>

<p class="p1">I do not mean to be disrespectful, but the attempt of the Lords to stop
the progress of reform reminds me very forcibly of the great storm of
Sidmouth, and of the conduct of the excellent Mrs. Partington on that
occasion. In the winter of 1824 there set in a great flood upon that
town&mdash;the tide rose to an incredible height&mdash;the waves rushed in upon
the houses&mdash;and everything was threatened with destruction. In the
midst of this sublime storm, Dame Partington, who lived upon the beach,
was seen at the door of her house with mop and pattens, trundling her
mop, and squeezing out the seawater, and vigorously pushing away the
Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic was roused; Mrs. Partington’s spirit was
up; but I need not tell you that the contest was unequal. The Atlantic
Ocean beat Mrs. Partington. She was excellent at a slop or a puddle,
but she should not have meddled with a tempest.&mdash;(From a Speech at
Taunton in 1831.)</p>

<p>And we add the ever popular Recipe for a Salad.</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <h4><i>SALAD</i></h4>
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>To make this condiment, your poet begs</div>
        <div>The pounded yellow of two hard-boiled eggs.</div>
        <div>Two boiled potatoes, passed through kitchen-sieve,</div>
        <div>Smoothness and softness to the salad give.</div>
        <div>Let onion atoms lurk within the bowl,</div>

        <div>Of mordant mustard add a single spoon,</div>
        <div>Distrust the condiment that bites so soon;</div>
        <div>But deem it not, thou man of herbs, a fault,</div>

        <div>Oh, green and glorious! Oh, herbaceous treat!</div>
        <div>’Twould tempt the dying anchorite to eat;</div>
        <div>Back to the world he’d turn his fleeting soul,</div>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Charles Lamb, beloved alike of the humorous and serious minded,
disagrees with Sydney Smith regarding the pun.</p>

<p>His opinion,</p>

<p>“A pun is a noble thing <i>per se</i>. It is a sole digest of
reflection; it is entire; it fills the mind; it is as perfect as a
sonnet&mdash;better. It limps ashamed in the train and retinue of humour; it
knows it should have an establishment of its own.”</p>

<p class="p-left">is shown in this instance.</p>

<p>Lamb was reserved among strangers. A friend, about to introduce him to
a circle of new faces, said, “Now will you promise, <i>Lamb</i>, not to
be as <i>sheepish</i> as usual?” Charles replied, with a rustic air, “I
<i>wool</i>.”</p>

<p>Such masterpieces as Lamb’s <i>Dissertation Upon Roast Pig</i>, and his
<i>Farewell to Tobacco</i> are too lengthy to quote. We give some of
his shorter witty allusions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Coleridge went to Germany, and left word to Lamb that if he wished any
information on any subject, he might apply to him (i.e., by letter), so
Lamb sent him the following abstruse propositions, to which, however,
Coleridge did not deign an answer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whether God loves a dying angel better than a true man?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whether the archangel Uriel <i>could</i> knowingly affirm an untruth,
and whether, if he <i>could</i>, he <i>would</i>?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whether the higher order of seraphim illuminati ever <i>sneeze</i>?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whether an immortal and amenable soul may not come <i>to be damned at
last</i>, and the man never suspect it beforehand?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[450]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Good Actions.</span>&mdash;The greatest pleasure I know is to do a good
action by stealth, and to have it found out by accident.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Paying for Things.</span>&mdash;One cannot bear to pay for articles he
used to get for nothing. When Adam laid out his first penny upon
nonpareils at some stall in Mesopotamia, I think it went hard with
him, reflecting upon his old goodly orchard, where he had so many for
nothing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Nothing to do.</span>&mdash;Positively the best thing a man can have to do
is nothing, and, <i>next to that</i>, perhaps, good works.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Robert Southey, though one time Poet Laureate, is not to be too highly
rated as a writer. His humorous poems are largely of the “jagged
categorical” type, and are whimseys rather than wit.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the aspersion even then cast upon the pun, he regards
it as a legitimate vehicle.</p>


<h4><i>THE TEN LOST TRIBES OF ISRAEL</i></h4>

<p class="p1">That the lost ten tribes of Israel may be found in London, is a
discovery which any person may suppose he has made, when he walks for
the first time from the city to Wapping. That the tribes of Judah and
Benjamin nourish there is known to all mankind; and from them have
sprung the Scripites, and the Omniumites, and the Threepercentites.</p>

<p>But it is not so well known that many other tribes noticed in the Old
Testament are to be found in this island of Great Britain.</p>

<p>There are the Hittites, who excel in one branch of gymnastics. And
there are the Amorites, who are to be found in town and country;
and there are the Gadites, who frequent watering-places, and take
picturesque tours.</p>

<p>Among the Gadites I shall have some of my best readers, who being in
good humour with themselves and with everything else, except on a
rainy day, will even then be in good humour with me. There will be the
Amorites in their company;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[451]</span> and among the Amorites, too, there will be
some who in the overflowing of their love, will have some liking to
spare for the doctor and his faithful memorialist.</p>

<p>The poets, those especially who deal in erotics, lyrics, sentimentals,
or sonnets, are the Ah-oh-ites.</p>

<p>The gentlemen who speculate in chapels are the Puhites.</p>

<p>The chief seat of the Simeonites is at Cambridge; but they are spread
over the land. So are the Man-ass-ites, of whom the finest specimens
are to be seen in St. James’s Street, at the fashionable time of day
for exhibiting the dress and the person upon the pavement.</p>

<p>The freemasons are of the family of the Jachinites.</p>

<p>The female Haggites are to be seen, in low life wheeling barrows, and
in high life seated at card-tables.</p>

<p>The Shuhamites are the cordwainers.</p>

<p>The Teamanites attend the sales of the East India Company.</p>

<p>Sir James Mackintosh, and Sir James Scarlett, and Sir James Graham
belong to the Jim-nites.</p>

<p>Who are the Gazathites, if the people of London are not, where anything
is to be seen? All of them are the Gettites when they can, all would be
Havites if they could.</p>

<p>The journalists should be Geshurites, if they answered to their
profession; instead of this they generally turn out to be Geshuwrongs.</p>

<p>There are, however, three tribes in England, not named in the Old
Testament, who considerably outnumber all the rest. These are the High
Vulgarites, who are the children of Rahank and Phashan, the Middle
Vulgarites, who are the children of Mammon and Terade, and the Low
Vulgarities, who are the children of Tahag, Rahag, and Bohobtay-il.</p>

leg, remark that he is no longer a clergyman, but a <i>lame man</i>.
If a poet is seized with apoplexy, affect to disbelieve it, though you

call ‘sinking in the <i>sublime</i>’; a climbing boy suffocated in a
chimney meets with a <i>sootable</i> death; and a pretty girl having
caught the small-pox is to be much <i>pitted</i>. On the subject of
the ear and its defects, talk first of something in which a <i>cow
sticks</i>, and end by telling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[454]</span> the story of the man who, having taken
great pains to explain something to his companion, at last got into a
rage at his apparent stupidity, and exclaimed, ‘Why, my dear sir, don’t

said the other, ‘but I am D E F.’</p>

beautiful lines on the burial of Sir John Moore might have been the
production of Lord Byron’s muse, the late Mr. Sidney Taylor, somewhat
indignantly, claimed them for their rightful owner, the Rev. Charles
Wolfe. During the controversy a third claimant started up in the person
of a <i>soi-disant</i> “Doctor Marshall,” who turned out to be a Durham
blacksmith, and <i>his</i> pretensions a hoax. It was then that a

<p>Thomas De Quincey, one of the best of humorists wrote <i>Confessions of
an Opium Eater</i>, with alas, all the necessary conditions to speak at
first hand.</p>

<p>His clever essay, <i>Murder as a Fine Art</i>, we trust, was not
founded on facts. This delightful bit of foolery, one of his many witty
effusions, can be given only in part.</p>


<h4><i>MURDER AS ONE OF THE FINE ARTS</i></h4>

<p class="p1">The first murder is familiar to you all. As the inventor of murder, and
the father of the art, Cain must have been a man of first-rate genius.
All the Cains were men of genius. Tubal Cain invented tubes, I think,
or some such thing. But, whatever might be the originality and genius
of the artist, every art was then in its infancy, and the works must be
criticised with the recollection of that fact. Even Tubal’s work would
probably be little approved at this day in Sheffield; and therefore
of Cain (Cain senior, I mean) it is no disparagement to say, that his
performance was but so-so. Milton, however, is supposed to have thought
differently. By his way of relating the case, it should seem to have
been rather a pet murder with him, for he retouches it with an apparent
anxiety for its picturesque effect:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="ileft">“Whereat he inly raged; and, as they talk’d,</div>
        <div>Smote him into the midriff with a stone</div>
        <div>That beat out life. He fell; and, deadly pale,</div>
        <div>Groan’d out his soul <i>with gushing blood effused</i>.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Upon this, Richardson the painter, who had an eye for effect, remarks
as follows, in his <i>Notes on Paradise Lost</i>, p. 497: “It has been
thought,” says he, “that Cain beat&mdash;as the common saying is&mdash;the breath
out of his brother’s body with a great stone; Milton gives in to this,
with the addition, however, of a large wound.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But it is time that I should say a few words about the principles
of murder, not with a view to regulate your practice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[459]</span> but your
judgment. As to old women, and the mob of newspaper readers, they are
pleased with anything, provided it is bloody enough; but the mind of
sensibility requires something more. <i>First</i>, then, let us speak
of the kind of person who is adapted to the purpose of the murderer;
<i>secondly</i>, of the place where; <i>thirdly</i>, of the time when,
and other little circumstances.</p>

<p>As to the person, I suppose that it is evident that he ought to be a
good man; because, if he were not, he might himself, by possibility, be
contemplating murder at the very time; and such “diamond-cut-diamond”
tussles, though pleasant enough when nothing better is stirring, are
really not what a critic can allow himself to call murders.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The subject chosen ought to be in good health: for it is absolutely
barbarous to murder a sick person, who is usually quite unable to
bear it. On this principle, no tailor ought to be chosen who is above
twenty-five, for after that age he is sure to be dyspeptic. Or at
least, if a man will hunt in that warren, he will of course think it
his duty, on the old established equation, to murder some multiple of
9&mdash;say 18, 27, or 36. And here, in this benign attention to the comfort
of sick people, you will observe the usual effect of a fine art to
soften and refine the feelings. The world in general, gentlemen, are
very bloody-minded; and all they want in a murder is a copious effusion
of blood; gaudy display in this point is enough for <i>them</i>. But
the enlightened connoisseur is more refined in his taste; and from our
art, as from all the other liberal arts when thoroughly mastered, the
result is, to humanise the heart.</p>

<p>A philosophic friend, well known for his philanthropy and general
benignity, suggests that the subject chosen ought also to have a
family of young children wholly dependent upon his exertions, by
way of deepening the pathos. And, undoubtedly, this is a judicious
caution. Yet I would not insist too keenly on such a condition. Severe
good taste unquestionably suggests it; but still, where the man was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[460]</span>
otherwise unobjectionable in point of morals and health, I would not
look with too curious a jealousy to a restriction which might have the
effect of narrowing the artist’s sphere.</p>

<p>So much for the person. As to the time, the place, and the tools, I
have many things to say, which at present I have no room for. The
good sense of the practitioner has usually directed him to night and
privacy. Yet there have not been wanting cases where this rule was
departed from with excellent effect.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Byron</span>, whose works are variously adjudged by the critics,
owes much to the fact that he was possessed of a distinct and definite
sense of humor.</p>

<p>It is that which saves many of his long and dull stretches of verse
from utter unreadability.</p>

<p>His facile rhymes, apparently tossed off with little of or no effort,
embody in the best possible manner his graceful fun.</p>

<p>The <i>ottava rima</i> of Don Juan, though often careless, even
slovenly as to technical details, is surely the meter best fitted for
the theme.</p>

<p>The brothers James and Horace Smith, wrote what was in their day
considered lively and amusing humor, but which seems a trifle dry to
us. Their greatest work was the <i>Rejected Addresses</i>, a series of
parodies on the poets, such as Wordsworth, Southey, Coleridge, Scott,
Moore and many others.</p>

<p>One of these, an imitation of Wordsworth’s most simple style, succeeds
in parodying his mawkish affectations of childish simplicity and
nursery stammering.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that the feminine writers of this period showed
practically no evidence of humorous scintillation, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">[471]</span> we have
searched in vain through the writings of Ann and Jane Taylor, Mary
Russell Mitford, Felicia Hemans and Letitia Elizabeth Landon,&mdash;finding
only some unconscious humor, not at all intentional on the part of the
authoresses, as they were then called.</p>

<p>William Maginn was also adept at parody, but his work was ephemeral.</p>

<h4><i>NAUTICAL TERMS</i></h4>

<p class="p1">All the sailors were busy at work, and the first lieutenant cried out
to the gunner, “Now, Mr. Dispart, if you are ready, we’ll breech these
guns.”</p>

<p>“Now, my lads,” said the first lieutenant, “we must slug (the part the
breeches cover) more forward.” As I never had heard of a gun having
breeches, I was very curious to see what was going on, and went up
close to the first lieutenant, who said to me, “Youngster, hand me
that <i>monkey’s tail</i>.” I saw nothing like a <i>monkey’s tail</i>,
but I was so frightened that I snatched up the first thing that I saw,
which was a short bar of iron, and it so happened that it was the very
article which he wanted. When I gave it to him, the first lieutenant
looked at me, and said, “So you know what a monkey’s tail is already,
do you? Now don’t you ever sham stupid after that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">[475]</span></p>

<p>Thought I to myself, I’m very lucky, but if that’s a monkey’s tail,
it’s a very stiff one!</p>

<p>I resolved to learn the names of everything as fast as I could, that I
might be prepared, so I listened attentively to what was said; but I
soon became quite confused, and despaired of remembering anything.</p>

<p>“How is this to be finished off, sir?” inquired a sailor of the
boatswain.</p>

<p>“Why, I beg leave to hint to you, sir, in the most delicate manner
in the world,” replied the boatswain, “that it must be with a
<i>double-wall</i>&mdash;and be damned to you&mdash;don’t you know that yet?
Captain of the foretop,” said he, “up on your <i>horses</i>, and take
your <i>stirrups</i> up three inches.” “Aye, aye, sir.” I looked and
looked, but I could see no horses.</p>

<p>“Mr. Chucks,” said the first lieutenant to the boatswain, “what blocks
have we below&mdash;not on charge?”</p>

<p>“Let me see, sir. I’ve one <i>sister</i>, t’other we split in half the
other day, and I think I have a couple of <i>monkeys</i> down in the
store-room. I say, you Smith, pass that brace through the <i>bull’s
eye</i>, and take the <i>sheep-shank</i> out before you come down.”</p>

<p>And then he asked the first lieutenant whether something should not
be fitted with a <i>mouse</i> or only a <i>Turk’s-head</i>&mdash;told
him the <i>goose-neck</i> must be spread out by the armourer as
soon as the forge was up. In short, what with <i>dead-eyes</i> and
<i>shrouds</i>, <i>cats</i> and <i>cat-blocks</i>, <i>dolphins</i> and
<i>dolphin-strikers, whips</i> and <i>puddings</i>, I was so puzzled
with what I heard, that I was about to leave the deck in absolute
despair.</p>

<p>“And, Mr. Chucks, recollect this afternoon that you <i>bleed</i> all
the <i>buoys</i>.”</p>

<p>Bleed the boys, thought I; what can that be for? At all events, the
surgeon appears to be the proper person to perform that operation.</p>

<h4><i>COLD MUTTON, PUDDING, PANCAKES</i></h4>

<p class="p1">“What am I grumbling about, now? It’s very well for you to ask that!
I’m sure I’d better be out of the world than&mdash;there now, Mr Caudle;
there you are again! I <i>shall</i> speak, sir. It isn’t often I open
my mouth, Heaven knows! But you like to hear nobody talk but yourself.
You ought to have married a negro slave, and not any respectable woman.</p>

<p>“You’re to go about the house looking like thunder all the day, and
I’m not to say a word. Where do you think pudding’s to come from every
day? You show a nice example to your children, you do; complaining, and
turning your nose up at a sweet piece of cold mutton, because there’s
no pudding! You go a nice way to make ’em extravagant&mdash;teach ’em nice
lessons to begin the world with. Do you know what puddings cost; or do
you think they fly in at the window?</p>

<p>“You hate cold mutton. The more shame for you, Mr. Caudle. I’m sure
you’ve the stomach of a lord, you have. No, sir; I didn’t choose to
hash the mutton. It’s very easy for you to say hash it; but <i>I</i>
know what a joint loses in hashing: it’s a day’s dinner the less, if
it’s a bit. Yes, I dare say; other people may have puddings with cold
mutton. No doubt of it; and other people become bankrupts. But if ever
you get into the <i>Gazette</i>, it sha’n’t be <i>my</i> fault&mdash;no;
I’ll do my duty as a wife to you, Mr. Caudle; you shall never have it
to say that it was <i>my</i> housekeeping that brought you to beggary.
No; you may sulk at the cold meat&mdash;ha! I hope you’ll never live to want
such a piece of cold mutton as we had to-day! and you may threaten
to go to a tavern to dine; but, with our present means, not a crumb
of pudding do you get from me. You shall have nothing but the cold
joint&mdash;nothing, as I’m a Christian sinner.</p>

<p>“Yes; there you are, throwing those fowls in my face again! I know you
once brought home a pair of fowls; I know it; but you were mean enough
to want to stop ’em out of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">[477]</span> week’s money! Oh, the selfishness&mdash;the
shabbiness of men! They can go out and throw away pounds upon pounds
with a pack of people who laugh at ’em afterward; but if it’s anything
wanted for their own homes, their poor wives may hunt for it. I wonder
you don’t blush to name those fowls again! I wouldn’t be so little for
the world, Mr. Caudle!</p>

<p>“What are you going to do? <i>Going to get up?</i> Don’t make yourself
ridiculous, Mr. Caudle; I can’t say a word to you like any other wife,
but you must threaten to get up. <i>Do</i> be ashamed of yourself.</p>

<p>“Puddings, indeed! Do you think I’m made of puddings? Didn’t you have
some boiled rice three weeks ago? Besides, is this the time of the
year for puddings? It’s all very well if I had money enough allowed
me like any other wife to keep the house with; then, indeed, I might
have preserves like any other woman; now, it’s impossible; and it’s
cruel&mdash;yes, Mr. Caudle, cruel&mdash;of you to expect it.</p>

<p>“<i>Apples ar’n’t so dear, are they?</i> I know what apples are, Mr.
Caudle, without your telling me. But I suppose you want something more
than apples for dumplings? I suppose sugar costs something, doesn’t it?
And that’s how it is. That’s how one expense brings on another, and
that’s how people go to ruin.</p>

<p>“<i>Pancakes?</i> What’s the use of your lying muttering there about
pancakes? Don’t you always have ’em once a year&mdash;every Shrove Tuesday?
And what would any moderate, decent man want more?</p>

<p>“Pancakes, indeed! Pray, Mr. Caudle&mdash;no, it’s no use your saying fine
words to me to let you go to sleep; I sha’n’t. Pray, do you know the
price of eggs just now? There’s not an egg you can trust to under seven
and eight a shilling; well, you’ve only just to reckon up how many
eggs&mdash;don’t lie swearing there at the eggs in that manner, Mr. Caudle;
unless you expect the bed to let you fall through. You call yourself a
respectable tradesman, I suppose? Ha! I only wish people knew you as
well as I do! Swearing at eggs, indeed! But I’m tired of this usage,
Mr. Caudle; quite tired of it; and I don’t care how soon it’s ended!</p>

<p>“Call that a kind man,” said an actor of an absent acquaintance; “a man
who is away from his family, and never sends them a farthing! Call that
kindness!” “Yes, unremitting kindness,” Jerrold replied.</p>

<p>Some member of “Our Club,” hearing an air mentioned, exclaimed: “That
always carries me away when I hear it.” “Can nobody whistle it?”
exclaimed Jerrold.</p>

<p>A friend said to Jerrold: “Have you heard about poor R&mdash;&mdash; [a lawyer]?
His business is going to the devil.” Jerrold answered: “That’s all
right: then he is sure to get it back again.”</p>

<p>Jerrold met Alfred Bunn one day in Piccadilly. Bunn stopped Jerrold,
and said, “I suppose you’re strolling about, picking up character.”
“Well, not exactly,” said Jerrold, “but there’s plenty lost hereabouts.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Jerrold was seriously disappointed with a certain book written by
one of his friends. This friend heard that he had expressed his
disappointment. <i>Friend</i> (to Jerrold): “I heard you said it was
the worst book I ever wrote.” <i>Jerrold</i>: “No, I didn’t. I said it
was the worst book anybody ever wrote.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some one was talking with him about a gentleman as celebrated for
the intensity as for the shortness of his friendships.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">[479]</span> “Yes,” said
Jerrold, “his friendships are so warm, that he no sooner takes them up
than he puts them down again.”</p>

<p>Thomas Moore, called the most successful Irishman of letters of the
nineteenth century, early developed a taste for music and a talent for
versification. To this add his native wit, and we have a humorist of no

<p>He wrote epistles, odes, satires and songs with equal facility, and to
these he added books of travel and biography and history.</p>

<p>His quick wit is shown in his lighter verse and epigrams.</p>

<p>Winthrop Mackworth Praed belongs to the small group of Londoners which
also included Calverley and Locker-Lampson. At least one great critic
considers Praed the greatest of this band, and so far as metric skill
and finished execution are concerned, he may well be called so. Also,
his taste is impeccable, and his society verse ranks among the best.</p>

<p>William Makepeace Thackeray, combining all the highest mental and moral
qualities in his work, adds thereto a delicate and subtle humor, never
broad, but always forcible and original.</p>

<p>This permeates all his novels, which, of course, may not be quoted
here, even in excerpts.</p>

<p>But Thackeray was equally happy in verse, and his contributions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">[487]</span> to

<p>Charles Dickens, in some senses the world’s greatest humorist, is too
much of a household word, to need either introduction or quotation.</p>

<p>Nor is it easy to quote from his books, which must be read in their
entirety or in long instalments to get their message.</p>

<p>One short extract is given, from <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>.</p>


<h4><i>MRS. GAMP’S APARTMENT</i></h4>

<p class="p1">Mrs. Gamp’s apartment in Kingsgate Street, High Holborn, wore,
metaphorically speaking, a robe of state. It was swept and garnished
for the reception of a visitor. That visitor was Betsy Prig; Mrs.
Prig of Bartlemy’s; or, as some said, Barklemy’s; or, as some said,
Bardlemy’s; for by all these endearing and familiar appellations had
the hospital of St. Bartholomew become a household word among the
sisterhood which Betsy Prig adorned.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gamp’s apartment was not a spacious one, but, to a contented mind,
a closet is a palace; and the first-floor front at Mr. Sweedlepipe’s
may have been, in the imagination of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">[492]</span> Mrs. Gamp, a stately pile. If it
were not exactly that to restless intellects, it at least comprised as
much accommodation as any person not sanguine to insanity could have
looked for in a room of its dimensions. For only keep the bedstead
always in your mind, and you were safe. That was the grand secret.
Remembering the bedstead, you might even stoop to look under the little
round table for anything you had dropped, without hurting yourself
much against the chest of drawers, or qualifying as a patient of St.
Bartholomew by falling into the fire. Visitors were much assisted in
their cautious efforts to preserve an unflagging recollection of this
piece of furniture by its size, which was great. It was not a turn-up
bedstead, nor yet a French bedstead, nor yet a four-post bedstead,
but what is poetically called a tent; the sacking whereof was low and
bulgy, insomuch that Mr. Gamp’s box would not go under it, but stopped
half way, in a manner which, while it did violence to the reason,
likewise endangered the legs of a stranger. The frame, too, which
would have supported the canopy and hangings, if there had been any,
was ornamented with divers pippins carved in timber, which, on the
slightest provocation, and frequently on none at all, came tumbling
down, harassing the peaceful guest with inexplicable terrors. The bed
itself was decorated with a patchwork quilt of great antiquity; and
at the upper end, upon the side nearest to the door, hung a scanty
curtain of blue check, which prevented the zephyrs that were abroad in
Kingsgate Street from visiting Mrs. Gamp’s head too roughly.</p>

<p>The chairs in Mrs. Gamp’s apartment were extremely large and
broad-backed, which was more than a sufficient reason for their being
but two in number. They were both elbow-chairs of ancient mahogany,
and were chiefly valuable for the slippery nature of their seats,
which had been originally horsehair, but were now covered with a shiny
substance of a bluish tint, from which the visitor began to slide away,
with a dismayed countenance, immediately after sitting down. What Mrs.
Gamp wanted in chairs she made up in band-boxes, of which she had a
great collection, devoted to the reception of various miscellaneous
valuables, which were not, however, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">[493]</span> well protected as the good
woman, by a pleasant fiction, seemed to think; for though every
band-box had a carefully-closed lid, not one among them had a bottom,
owing to which cause the property within was merely, as it were,
extinguished. The chest of drawers having been originally made to stand
upon the top of another chest, had a dwarfish, elfin look alone; but,
in regard of security, it had a great advantage over the band-boxes,
for as all the handles had been long ago pulled off, it was very
difficult to get at its contents. This, indeed, was only to be done
by one of two devices; either by tilting the whole structure forward
until all the drawers fell out together, or by opening them singly with
knives, like oysters.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gamp stored all her household matters in a little cupboard by the
fireplace; beginning below the surface (as in nature) with the coals,
and mounting gradually upwards to the spirits, which, from motives
of delicacy, she kept in a teapot. The chimney-piece was ornamented
with an almanac; it was also embellished with three profiles; one,
in colors, of Mrs. Gamp herself in early life; one, in bronze, of a
lady in feathers, supposed to be Mrs. Harris, as she appeared when
dressed for a ball; and one, in black, of Mr. Gamp deceased. The last
was a full-length, in order that the likeness might be rendered more
obvious and forcible, by the introduction of the wooden leg. A pair
of bellows, a pair of pattens, a toasting-fork, a kettle, a spoon for
the administration of medicine to the refractory, and lastly, Mrs.
Gamp’s umbrella, which, as something of great price and rarity, was
displayed with particular ostentation, completed the decorations of the
chimney-piece and adjacent wall.</p>

<p>William Edmonstoune Aytoun and Theodore Martin, two young men of
brilliant brains, produced together the collection of burlesque and
parodies known as <i>The Bon Gaultier Ballads</i>.</p>

<p>At this time, the middle of the eighteenth century, parody was greatly
in vogue. The Ballads were whimsical, and as a whole, kindly. They were
extremely popular, as much so as the Rejected Addresses, but today they
seem dull and rather futile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">[494]</span></p>

<p>Another vogue of the day was Bathos, of which the following is a fair
example.</p>

<p>Charles Kingsley, a clergyman of attainments, possessed the same type
of whimsical humor as the later and greater Lewis Carroll.</p>

<p>His <i>Water Babies</i> from which a short extract is given, is a
classic in child literature.</p>


<h4><i>THE PROFESSOR’S MALADY</i></h4>

<p class="p1">They say that no one has ever yet seen a water-baby. For my part, I
believe that the naturalists get dozens of them when they are out
dredging, but they say nothing about them and throw them overboard
again, for fear of spoiling their theories. But you see the professor
was found out, as every one is in due time. A very terrible old fairy
found the professor out. She felt his bumps, and cast his nativity, and
took the lunars of him carefully inside and out; and so she knew what
he would do as well as if she had seen it in a print book, as they say
in the dear old west country. And he did it. And so he was found out
beforehand, as everybody always is; and the old fairy will find out the
naturalists some day, and put them in the <i>Times</i>; and then on
whose side will the laugh be?</p>

<p>So all the doctors in the country were called in to make a report on
his case; and of course every one of them flatly contradicted the
other: else what use is there in being men of science? But at last the
majority agreed on a report, in the true medical language, one half
bad Latin, the other half worse Greek, and the rest what might have
been English, if they had only learned to write it. And this is the
beginning thereof:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">[499]</span></p>

<p>“The subanhypaposupernal anastomoses of peritomic diacellurite in the
encephalo-digital region of the distinguished individual of whose
symptomatic phenomena we had the melancholy honour (subsequent to a
preliminary diagnostic inspection) of making an inspectorial diagnosis,
presenting the interexclusively quadrilateral and antinomian diathesis
known as Bumpsterhausen’s blue follicles, we proceeded&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But what they proceeded to do my lady never knew, for she was so
frightened at the long words that she ran for her life, and locked
herself into her bedroom, for fear of being squashed by the words and
strangled by the sentence. A boa-constrictor, she said, was bad company
enough; but what was a boa-constrictor made of paving-stones?</p>

<p>“It was quite shocking! What can they think is the matter with him?”
said she to the old nurse.</p>

<p>“That his wit’s just addled; maybe wi’ unbelief and heathenry,” quoth
she.</p>

<p>“Then why can’t they say so?”</p>

<p>And the heaven, and the sea, and the rocks and vales re-echoed, “Why,
indeed?” But the doctors never heard them.</p>

<p>So she made Sir John write to the <i>Times</i> to command the
chancellor of the exchequer for the time being to put a tax on long
words:</p>

<p>A light tax on words over three syllables, which are necessary evils,
like rats, but, like them, must be kept down judiciously.</p>

<p>A heavy tax on words over four syllables, as heterodoxy, spontaneity,
spiritualism, spuriosity, etc.</p>

<p>And on words over five syllables (of which I hope no one will wish to
see any examples), a totally prohibitory tax.</p>

<p>And a similar prohibitory tax on words derived from three or more
languages at once, words derived from two languages, having become so
common that there was no more hope of rooting out them than of rooting
out peth-winds.</p>

<p>The chancellor of the exchequer, being a scholar and a man of sense,
jumped at the notion, for he saw in it the one and only plan for
abolishing Schedule D. But when he brought in his bill, most of the
Irish members, and (I am sorry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">[500]</span> to say) some of the Scotch likewise,
opposed it most strongly, on the ground that in a free country no man
was bound either to understand himself or to let others understand him.
So the bill fell through on the first reading, and the chancellor,
being a philosopher, comforted himself with the thought that it was
not the first time that a woman had hit off a grand idea, and the men
turned up their stupid noses thereat.</p>

<p>Robert Browning, though scarcely to be called a humorous poet, had a
fine wit and a quick and agile sense of whimsey.</p>

<p>His <i>Pied Piper of Hamelin</i>, written to amuse a sick child of
Macready’s, is a masterpiece of quiet humor. His satiric vein is shown

<p>Frederick Locker-Lampson, though following in the footsteps of Praed,
was a more famous writer of the rhymes known as Vers de Société.</p>

<p>There is no English equivalent for the French term, and attempts
to coin one are usually failures. Society verse, Familiar Verse,
Occasional verse,&mdash;each lacks somewhat of the real implication.</p>

<p>Locker-Lampson, himself a discerning and severe critic, instructs us
that the rhymes should be short, graceful, refined and fanciful, not
seldom distinguished by chastened sentiment, and often playful.</p>

<p>But, really, playfulness and light, bright humor are more a distinctive
quality of Vers de Société than that dictum stipulates.</p>

<p>Wit is the keynote, fun the undercurrent of the best of the material
so often collected under this name; and Locker-Lampson made the
first and perhaps the best collection, under the title of <i>Lyra
Elegantiarum</i>.</p>

<p>Typical of all that goes to make up the best form of Vers de Société is
his poem,</p>

<p>Charles Stuart Calverley is called the Prince of Parodists, but his
genius deserves far higher praise than that.</p>

<p>His serious work is of a high order but it is for his humorous verse
that he is most loved and praised.</p>

<p>His parodies while showing the best and finest burlesque qualities, are
also poems in themselves, and are of an exquisite wit and a spontaneous
humor rarely excelled.</p>

<p>One of the best is the ballad in which Rossetti’s manner is parodied in
very spirit.</p>

<p>Charles Lutwidge Dodgson is better known as Lewis Carroll, though
during his lifetime, the author of <i>Alice</i> was extremely careful
to preserve a decided distinction between the College Don and the
writer of nonsense.</p>

<p>Lewis Carroll was the first to produce coherent humor in the form of
sheer nonsense, and his work, often imitated, has never been equaled.</p>

<p>Beside the <i>Alice</i> books he wrote several volumes only a degree
less wise and witty in the nonsense vein.</p>

<p>But few selections can be given.</p>

<p>Edward Lear, contemporary of Lewis Carroll, is the only peer of the
great writer of nonsense.</p>

<p>Lear’s nonsense is in different vein, but his verses are equally facile
and felicitous and his prose quite as delightfully extravagant.</p>

<p>If Carroll’s imagination was more exquisitely fanciful, Lear’s had
a broader scope, and both writers are masters of that peculiar
combination of paradox and reasoning that makes for delightful surprise.</p>

<p>Lear was the first to make popular the style of stanza since called
a Limerick, though the derivation of this name has never been
satisfactorily determined.</p>

<p>Algernon Charles Swinburne, whose marvelous mastery of the lyric is
well known, is not so noted as a humorist.</p>

<p>Yet his parodies are among the finest in the language. His day was the
Golden Age of Parody, and the writers who achieved it were true poets
and true wits.</p>

<p>This parody of Tennyson is alike a perfect mimicry of sound and sense.</p>

<p>William Schwenck Gilbert began as a youth his humorous contributions to
magazines, which included the immortal <i>Bab Ballads</i>.</p>

<p>Ten years later he joined forces with the composer, Arthur Sullivan,
and the result of this collaboration was the well known series of
operas of which <i>Trial By Jury</i> was the first.</p>

<p>Gilbert is second to none in humorous paradoxical thought and sprightly
and clever versification. His themes, subtle and fantastic, are worked
out with a serious absurdity as truly witty as it is charming.</p>

<p>James Matthew Barrie, one of the finest English humorists, may not be
quoted successfully because his work is only found in sustained stories
or plays, and few brief extracts will bear separation from their
contexts.</p>

<p>A short passage from <i>A Window in Thrums</i> will hint at the
delightfulness of Barrie’s humor.</p>


<h4><i>A HUMOURIST ON HIS CALLING</i></h4>

<p class="p1">Tammas put his foot on the pail.</p>

<p>“I tak no credit,” he said modestly, on the evening, I remember, of
Willie Pyatt’s funeral, “in bein’ able to speak wi’ a sort o’ faceelity
on topics ’at I’ve made my ain.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” said T’nowhead, “but it’s no faceelity o’ speakin’ ’at taks me.
There’s Davit Lunan ’at can speak like as if he had learned if aff a
paper, an’ yet I canna thole ’im.”</p>

<p>“Davit,” said Hendry, “doesna speak in a wy ’at a body can follow ’im.
He doesna gae even on. Jess says he’s juist like a man aye at the
cross-roads, an’ no sure o’ his way. But the stock has words, an’ no
ilka body has that.”</p>

<p>“If I was bidden to put Tammas’s gift in a word,” said T’nowhead, “I
would say ’at he had a wy. That’s what I would say.”</p>

<p>“Weel, I suppose I have,” Tammas admitted, “but, wy or no wy, I couldna
put a point on my words if it wasna for my sense o’ humour. Lads,
humour’s what gies the nip to speakin’.”</p>

<p>“It’s what maks ye a sarcesticist, Tammas,” said Hendry; “but what I
wonder at is yer sayin’ the humorous things sae aisy-like. Some says ye
mak them up aforehand, but I ken that’s no true.”</p>

<p>“No, only is’t no true,” said Tammas, “but it couldna be true. Them ’at
says sic things, an’ weel I ken you’re meanin’ Davit Lunan, hasna nae
idea o’ what humour is. It’s a thing ’at spouts oot o’ its ain accord.
Some o’ the maist humorous things I’ve ever said cam oot, as a body may
say, by themselves.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s the case,” said T’nowhead; “an’ yet it maun be you
’at brings them up?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">[536]</span></p>

<p>“There’s no nae doubt about its bein’ the case,” said Tammas; “for
I’ve watched mysel’ often. There was a vera guid instance occurred
sune after I married Easie. The earl’s son met me one day, aboot that
time, i’ the Tenements, an’ he didna ken ’at Chirsty was deid, an’ I’d
married again. ‘Well, Haggart,’ he says, in his frank wy, ‘and how is
your wife?’ ‘She’s vera weel, sir,’ I maks answer, ‘but she’s no the
ane you mean.’”</p>

<p>“Na, he meant Chirsty,” said Hendry.</p>

<p>“Is that a’ the story?” asked T’nowhead</p>

<p>Tammas had been looking at us queerly.</p>

<p>“There’s no nane o’ ye lauchin’,” he said, “but I can assure ye the
earl’s son gaed east the toon lauchin’ like onything.”</p>

<p>“But what was’t he lauched at?”</p>

<p>“Ou,” said Tammas, “a humourist doesna tell whaur the humour comes in.”</p>

<p>“No, but when you said that, did ye mean it to be humourous?”</p>

<p>“Am no sayin’ I did, but as I’ve been tellin’ ye humour spouts oot by
itsel’.”</p>

<p>“Aye, but do ye ken noo what the earl’s son gaed awa lauchin’ at?”</p>

<p>Tammas hesitated.</p>

<p>“I dinna exactly see’t,” he confessed, “but that’s no an oncommon
thing. A humourist would often no ken ’at he was are if it wasna by the
wy he maks other fowk lauch. A body canna be expeckit baith to mak the
joke an’ to see’t. Na, that would be doin’ twa fowks’ wark.”</p>

<p>“Weel, that’s reasonable enough, but I’ve often seen ye lauchin’,” said
Hendry, “lang afore other fowk lauched.”</p>

<p>“Nae doubt,” Tammas explained, “an’ that’s because humour has twa
sides, juist like a penny piece. When I say a humorous thing mysel’ I’m
dependent on other fowk to tak note o’ the humour o’t, bein’ mysel’
taen up wi’ the makkin’ o’t. Aye, but there’s things I see an’ hear at’
maks me laucht, an’ that’s the other side o’ humour.”</p>

<p>“I never heard it put sae plain afore,” said T’nowhead,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">[537]</span> “an’, sal, am
no nane sure but what am a humourist too.”</p>

<p>“Na, na, no you, T’nowhead,” said Tammas hotly.</p>

<h3>FRENCH HUMOR</h3></div>


<p>Voltaire, the assumed name of François Marie Arouet, was one of the
most famous of French writers. Plays, fiction, criticism and letters
are among his celebrated works.</p>

<p>We can quote but a short bit from his novel of <i>Candide</i>:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The tutor Pangloss was the oracle of the house, and little Candide
listened to his lessons with all the ready faith natural to his age and
disposition.</p>

<p>Pangloss used to teach the science of
metaphysico-theologo-cosmologo-noodleology. He demonstrated most
admirably that there is no effect without a cause, and that, in this
best of all possible worlds, the castle of my lord baron was the most
magnificent of castles, and my lady the best of all possible baronesses.</p>

<p>“It has been proved,” said he, “that things cannot be otherwise than
they are; for, everything being made for a certain end, the end for
which everything is made is necessarily the best end. Observe how noses
were made to carry spectacles, and spectacles we have accordingly. Our
legs are clearly intended for shoes and stockings, so we have them.
Stone has been formed to be hewn and dressed for building castles, so
my lord has a very fine one, for it is meet that the greatest baron in
the province should have the best accommodation. Pigs were made to be
eaten, and we eat pork all the year round. Consequently those who have
asserted that all is well have said what is silly; they should have
said of everything that is, that it is the best that could possibly be.”</p>

<p>Candide listened attentively, and innocently believed all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_561">[561]</span> that he
heard; for he thought Mlle. Cunégonde extremely beautiful, though he
never had the boldness to tell her so. He felt convinced that, next
to the happiness of being born Baron of Thundertentronckh, the second
degree of happiness was to be Mlle. Cunégonde, the third to see her
every day, and the fourth to hear Professor Pangloss, the greatest
philosopher in the province, and therefore in all the world.</p>

<p>One day Mlle. Cunégonde, while taking a walk near the castle, in the
little wood which was called the park, saw through the bushes Dr.
Pangloss giving a lesson in experimental physics to her mother’s
chambermaid, a little brunette, very pretty and very willing to learn.
As Mlle. Cunégonde had a great taste for science, she watched with
breathless interest the repeated experiments that were carried on under
her eyes; she clearly perceived that the doctor had sufficient reason
for all he did; she saw the connection between causes and effects, and
returned home much agitated, though very thoughtful, and filled with
a yearning after scientific pursuits, for sharing in which she wished
that young Candide might find sufficient reason in her, and that she
might find the same in him.</p>

<p>She met Candide as she was on her way back to the castle, and blushed;
the youth blushed likewise. She bade him good morning in a voice
that struggled for utterance; and Candide answered her without well
knowing what he was saying. Next day, as the company were leaving the
table after dinner, Cunégonde and Candide found themselves behind a
screen. Cunégonde let fall her handkerchief; Candide picked it up; she
innocently took hold of his hand, and the young man, as innocently,
kissed hers with an ardor, a tenderness, and a grace quite peculiar;
their lips met and their eyes sparkled. His lordship, the Baron of
Thundertentronckh, happened to pass by the screen, and, seeing that
particular instance of cause and effect, drove Candide out of the
castle with vigorous kicks. Cunégonde swooned away, but, as soon as she
recovered, my lady the baroness boxed her ears, and all was confusion
and consternation in that most magnificent and most charming of all
possible castles.</p>

<p>A great name that ushers in the Nineteenth century is that of Honoré de
Balzac, chief of the realistic school of French novelists. His humor is
keen and is never lacking in his somewhat diversified writings.</p>

<p>From his well known <i>Contes Drolatiques</i> we give two stories.</p>


<h4><i>A SLIGHT MISUNDERSTANDING</i></h4>

<p class="p1">Louis XI had given the Abbey of Turpenay to a gentleman who, enjoying
the revenue, had called himself M. de Turpenay. It happened that the
king being at Plessis-les-Tours, the real abbot, who was a monk, came
and presented himself before the king, and presented a petition,
remonstrating with him that, canonically and monastically, he was
entitled to the abbey, and the usurping gentleman wronged him of his
right, and therefore he called upon his Majesty to have justice done
to him. Nodding his peruke, the king promised to render him contented.
This monk, importunate as are all hooded animals, came often at the end
of the king’s meals, who, bored with the holy water of the convent,
called friend Tristan and said to him, “Old fellow, there is here a
Turpenay who annoys me; rid the world of him for me.”</p>

<p>Tristan, taking a frock for a monk, or a monk for a frock, came to
this gentleman, whom all the court called M. de Turpenay, and, having
accosted him, managed to lead him on one side, then, taking him by the
button-hole, gave him to understand that the king desired he should
die. He tried to resist, supplicating and supplicating to escape,
but in no way could he obtain a hearing. He was delicately strangled
between the head and shoulders, so that he expired; and, three hours
afterwards, Tristan told the king that he was despatched. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_568">[568]</span> happened
five days later, which is the space in which souls come back again,
that the monk came into the room where the king was, and when he saw
him he was much astonished. Tristan was present; the king called him,
and whispered into his ear:</p>

<p>“You have not done what I told you to.”</p>

<p>“Saving your Majesty, I have done it. Turpenay is dead.”</p>

<p>“Eh? I meant this monk.”</p>

<p>“I understood the gentleman!”</p>

<p>“What, it is done, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes, your Majesty.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then”&mdash;turning toward the monk&mdash;“come here, monk.” The monk
approached. The king said to him, “Kneel down.” The poor monk began to
shiver in his shoes. But the king said to him, “Thank God that He has
not willed that you should be executed as I had ordered. He who took
your estates has been instead. God has done you justice. Go and pray to
God for me, and don’t stir out of your convent.”</p>

<p>This proves the good-heartedness of Louis XI. He might very well
have hanged the monk, the cause of the error. As for the aforesaid
gentleman, it was given out that he had died in the king’s service.</p>


<h4><i>INNOCENCE</i></h4>

<p class="p1">When Queen Catherine was princess royal, to make herself welcome to
the king, her father-in-law, who at that time was very ill indeed, she
presented him from time to time with Italian pictures, knowing that he
liked them much, being a friend of Sire Raphael d’Urbino and of the
Sires Primaticcio and Leonardo da Vinci, to whom he sent large sums
of money. She obtained from her family a precious picture, painted by
a Venetian named Titian (painter to the Emperor Charles, and in very
high favor), in which there were portraits of Adam and Eve at the
moment when God left them to wander about the terrestrial paradise.
They were painted full height, in the costume of the period, in which
it is difficult to make a mistake, because they were attired in their
ignorance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_569">[569]</span> and caparisoned with the divine grace which enveloped
them&mdash;a difficult thing to execute on account of the color, but one
in which the said Sire Titian excelled. The picture was put into the
room of the poor king, who was then ill with the disease of which he
eventually died. It had a great success at the Court of France, where
every one wished to see it; but no one was able to until after the
king’s death, since at his desire it was allowed to remain in his room
as long as he lived.</p>

<p>One day Catherine took with her to the king’s room her son Francis and
little Margy, who began to talk at random, as children will. Now here,
now there, these children had heard this picture of Adam and Eve spoken
about, and had tormented their mother to take them to see it. Since
the two little ones sometimes amused the old king, the princess royal
complied with their request.</p>

<p>“You wished to see Adam and Eve, who were our first parents; there they
are,” said she.</p>

<p>Then she left them in great astonishment before Titian’s picture, and
seated herself by the bedside of the king, who delighted to watch the
children.</p>

<p>“Which of the two is Adam?” said Francis, nudging his sister Margaret’s
elbow.</p>

<p>“You silly,” replied she, “they would have to be dressed for one to
know that!”</p>

<p>Louis Charles Alfred de Musset was a celebrated French poet and man of
letters. Though he died in early middle age, he left many volumes of
wise and witty writings.</p>


<h4><i>THE SUPPER-PARTY OF THE THREE CAVALIERS</i></h4>

<p class="p1">“Be silent, all of you!” cried Mimi. “I want to talk a little now.
Since the magnificent M. Marcel does not care for fables, I am going to
relate a true story, <i>et quorum pars magna fui</i>.”</p>

<p>“Do you speak Latin?” asked Eugène.</p>

<p>“As you perceive,” Mlle. Pinson answered. “I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_570">[570]</span> inherited that
sentence from my uncle, who served under the great Napoleon, and who
always repeated it before he gave us an account of a battle. If you
don’t know the meaning of the words, I’ll teach you free of charge.
They mean, ‘I give you my word of honor.’ Well, then, you are to know
that one night last week I went with two of my friends, Blanchette and
Rougette, to the Odéon theater&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Watch me cut the cake,” interrupted Marcel.</p>

<p>“Cut ahead, but listen,” Mlle. Pinson continued. “As I was saying,
I went with Blanchette and Rougette to the Odéon to see a tragedy.
Rougette, as you know, has just lost her grandmother, and has inherited
four hundred francs. We had taken a box, opposite to which, in the
pit, sat three students. These young men liked our looks, and, on the
pretext that we were alone and unprotected, invited us to supper.”</p>

<p>“Immediately?” asked Marcel. “That was gallant indeed. And you refused,
I suppose?”</p>

<p>“By no means,” said Mimi. “We accepted the invitation, and in the
intermission, without waiting for the end of the play, we all went off
to Viot’s restaurant.”</p>

<p>“With your cavaliers?”</p>

<p>“With our cavaliers. The leader, of course, began by telling us that
he had nothing, but such little obstacles did not disconcert us.
We ordered everything we wanted. Rougette took pen and paper, and
ordered a veritable marriage-feast: shrimps, an omelet with sugar,
fritters, mussels, eggs with whipped cream&mdash;in fact, all the delicacies
imaginable. To tell the truth, our young gentlemen pulled wry faces&mdash;&mdash;
”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt of it!” said Marcel.</p>

<p>“We didn’t care. When everything was brought in we began to act the
part of great ladies. We approved of nothing, but found everything
disgusting. Hardly was any dish brought in but we sent it out again.
‘Waiter, take this away; it’s intolerable; where did you get the
horrible stuff?’ Our unknown gentlemen wanted to eat, but found it
impossible. In a word, we supped as Sancho dined, and in our vigor
nearly broke several dishes.”</p>

<p>“Nice conduct! And who was to pay for it all?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_571">[571]</span></p>

<p>“That is precisely the question that our three unknown gentlemen
asked one another. To judge by what we overheard of their whispered
conversation, one of them owned six francs, the second a good deal
less, and the third had only his watch, which he generously pulled
out of his pocket. So the three unfortunates went up to the cashier,
intending to gain a delay of some sort. What answer do you suppose they
received?”</p>

<p>“I imagine that you would be kept there, and your gentlemen sent to
jail.”</p>

<p>“You are wrong,” said Mlle. Pinson. “Before going in Rougette had
taken her precautions, and had paid for everything in advance. You can
imagine the scene when Viot answered, ‘Gentlemen, everything is paid.’
Our three unknown gentlemen looked at us as never three dogs looked at
three bishops, with pitiful stupefaction mixed with pure tenderness.
But we, without seeming to notice anything unusual, went down-stairs
and ordered a cab. ‘Dear Marquise,’ said Rougette to me, ‘we ought to
take these gentlemen home.’ ‘Certainly, dear Countess,’ answered I. Our
poor young gallants did not know what to say, they looked so sheepish.
They wanted to get rid of our politeness, and asked not to be taken
home, even refusing to give their address. No wonder, either, because
they felt sure that they were having to do with great ladies, and they
lived in Fish-Cat Street!”</p>

<p>The two students, the friends of Marcel, who, up to this time, had done
nothing but smoke their pipes and drink in silence, appeared little
pleased with this story. Their faces grew red, and they seemed to know
as much about this unfortunate supper as Mimi herself, at whom they
glanced restlessly. Marcel, laughing, said:</p>

<p>“Tell us who they were, Mlle. Mimi. Since it happened last week it does
not matter.”</p>

<p>“Never!” cried the girl. “Play a trick on a man&mdash;yes. But ruin his
career&mdash;never!”</p>

<p>“You are right,” said Eugène, “and are acting even more wisely than you
yourself are aware of. There is not a single young fellow at college
who has not some such mistake or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_572">[572]</span> folly behind him, and yet it is from
among these very people that France draws her most distinguished men.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Marcel, “that’s true. There are peers of France who now
dine at Flicoteau’s, but who once could not pay their bills. But,” he
added, and winked, “haven’t you seen your unknown gentlemen again?”</p>

<p>“What do you take us for?” answered Mlle. Pinson in a severe and almost
offended tone. “You know Blanchette and Rougette, and do you suppose
that I&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Marcel, “don’t be angry. But isn’t this a nice state
of affairs? Here are three giddy girls, who may not be able to pay
their next day’s dinner, and who throw away their money for the sake of
mystifying three poor unoffending devils!”</p>

<p>“But why did they invite us to supper?” asked Mlle. Pinson.&mdash;“<i>Mimi
Pinson.</i>”</p>

jest.</p>


<h4><i>THÉOPHILE’S MOTHER-IN-LAW</i></h4>

<p class="p1">“Son-in-law, you will offer me your arm; your wife will take her
cousin’s.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother-in-law.”</p>

<p>“Furthermore, when we get to the caterer’s for dinner, you must not
whisper to your wife. People might suspect something unrefined.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother-in-law.”</p>

<p>“Neither must you kiss her.”</p>

<p>“Why, you object to me kissing my wife?”</p>

<p>“Before people, yes. It’s very bad form. Haven’t you time enough for it
at home?”</p>

<p>“True.”</p>

<p>“At table you will not sit next to your wife, but next to me.”</p>

<p>“That’s agreed.”</p>

<p>“During the meal you will take care that no comic songs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_573">[573]</span> on your
marriage are sung. Those who write them usually permit themselves
indelicate jokes, so that the ladies are put out. That is the worst
taste possible.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see that none are sung.”</p>

<p>“You will dance only once with your wife during the evening. Understand
me&mdash;only once.”</p>

<p>“But, why, why?”</p>

<p>“Because it is proper to let the bride accept the invitations of
relatives, friends, and strangers.”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t marry in order that my wife should dance with everybody
except myself!”</p>

<p>“Do you wish to insinuate, son-in-law, that you can instruct me
concerning the usages of polite society? You are beginning well.”</p>

<p>“I assure you, mother-in-law, that I had no intention&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That will do. I accept your excuses. We now come to a more delicate
matter, to&mdash;but, of course, you must understand me.”</p>

<p>“I confess that I do not at all.”</p>

<p>“Listen, son-in-law. Some newly married young men, on their
wedding-night, when the ball is at its gayest, take the liberty of
carrying off their wives, and disappearing with them about twelve
o’clock.”</p>

<p>“And you object to that?”</p>

<p>“Fie, sir, fie! If you were to be guilty of such a thing, I would make
your wife sue for a divorce the day after your marriage.”</p>

<p>“Be easy, then; I will not disappear. But when may I go away with my
wife?”</p>

<p>“I shall take my daughter with me, and arrange an opportune time when
the decencies of the situation may be observed.”</p>

<p>“And who will take me?”</p>

<p>“You will go alone, but you will not go, understand me well, until
there isn’t a cat left at the ball.”</p>

<p>“I shall be getting to bed very late, then. Some of the people will
want square dances and country dances, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You will get to bed soon enough, son-in-law.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_574">[574]</span></p>

be prolonged.”</p>

<h4><i>CHAPTER TOUCHING THE OLFACTORY ORGAN</i></h4>

<p class="p1">Has it ever occurred to you, dear reader, how admirable an organ the
nose is?</p>

<p>The nose; yes, the nose.</p>

<p>And how useful an article this very nose is to every creature which, as
Ovid says, lifts its face to heaven?</p>

<p>Well, strange as it may seem, monstrous ingratitude that it is, no poet
has yet thought of addressing an ode to the nose!</p>

<p>So it has been left to me, who am not a poet, or who, at least, claim
to rank only after our greatest poets, to conceive such an idea.</p>

<p>Truly, the nose is unfortunate.</p>

<p>So many things have been invented for the eyes:</p>

<p>Songs and compliments and kaleidoscopes, pictures and scenery and
spectacles.</p>

<p>And for the ears:</p>

<p>Ear-rings, of course, and <i>Robert the Devil</i>, <i>William Tell</i>,
and <i>Fra Diavolo</i>, Stradivarius violins and Érard pianos and Sax
trumpets.</p>

<p>And for the mouth:</p>

<p>Lent, plain cooking, <i>The Gastronomists’ Calendar</i>, <i>The
Gormand’s Dictionary</i>. Soups of every kind have they made for it,
from Russian broth to French cabbage-soup; dishes for it are connected
with the reputations of the greatest men, from Soubise cutlets to
Richelieu puddings; its lips have been compared to coral, its teeth to
pearls, its breath to perfume. Before it have been set plumed peacocks
and undrawn snipes; and, for the future, it has been promised whole
roast larks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_575">[575]</span></p>

<p>But what has been invented for the nose?</p>

<p>Attar of roses and snuff.</p>

<p>You have not done well, oh, my masters the philanthropists; oh, my
brothers the poets!</p>

<p>And yet how faithfully this limb&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is not a limb!” cry the scientists.</p>

<p>I beg your pardon, gentlemen, and retract. This appendage&mdash;Ah yes, I
was saying with what touching fidelity this appendage has done service
for you.</p>

<p>The eyes sleep, the mouth closes, the ears are deaf.</p>

<p>The nose is always on duty.</p>

<p>It watches over your repose and contributes to your health. Feet,
hands, all other parts of the body are stupid. The hands are often
caught in foolish acts; the feet stumble, and in their clumsiness allow
the body to fall. And when they do, they get off free, and the poor
nose is punished for their misdeeds.</p>

<p>How often do you not hear it said: “Mr. So-and-So has broken his nose.”</p>

<p>There have been a great many broken noses since the creation of the
world.</p>

<p>Can any one give a single instance of a nose broken through any fault
of its own?</p>

<p>No; but, nevertheless, the poor nose is always being scolded.</p>

<p>Well, it endures it all with angelic patience. True, it sometimes has
the impertinence to snore. But where and when did you ever hear it
complain?...</p>

<p>But let us forget for a moment the utility of the nose, and regard it
only from the esthetic point of view.</p>

<p>A cedar of Lebanon, it tramples underfoot the hyssop of the mustache;
a central column, it provides a support for the double arch of the
eyebrows. On its capital perches the eagle of thought. It is enwreathed
with smiles. With what boldness did the nose of Ajax confront the storm
when he said, “I will escape in spite of the gods.” With what courage
did the nose of the great Condé&mdash;whose greatness really derived from
his nose&mdash;with what courage did the nose of the great Condé enter
before all others, before the great Condé himself, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_576">[576]</span> entrenchments
of the Spanish at Lens and Rocroy, where their conqueror boldly
flourished the staff of command? With what assurance was Dugazon’s
nose thrust before the public, that nose which knew how to wriggle in
forty-two different ways, and each way funnier than the last?</p>

<p>No, I do not believe that the nose should be permitted to remain in the
obscurity into which man’s ingratitude has hitherto forced it.</p>

<p>I suggest as one reason why the nose has submitted to this injustice
the fact that Occidental noses are so small.</p>

<p>But the deuce is to pay if the noses of the West are the only noses.</p>

<p>There are the Oriental noses, which are very handsome noses.</p>

<p>Do you question the superiority of these noses to your own, gentlemen
of Paris, of Vienna, of St. Petersburg?</p>

<p>In that case, my Viennese friends, go by the Danube; you Parisians,
take the steamer; Petersburgers, the sledge; and say these simple words:</p>

<p>“To Georgia.”</p>

<p>But I forewarn you of deep humiliation. Should you bring to Georgia one
of the largest noses in Europe, at the gate of Tiflis they would gaze
at you in astonishment and exclaim:</p>

<p>“What a pity that this gentleman has lost his nose on the way.” ...</p>

<p>Ah, sweet Heaven! those beautiful Georgian noses! Robust noses,
magnificent noses!</p>

<p>They are all shapes:</p>

<p>Round, fat, long, large.</p>

<p>There is every color:</p>

<p>White, pink, crimson, violet.</p>

<p>Some are set with rubies, others with pearls. I saw one set with
turquoises.</p>

<p>In Georgia, Vakhtang IV abolished the fathom, the meter, and the yard,
keeping only the nose.</p>

<p>Goods are measured off by the nose.</p>

<p>They say, “I bought seventeen noses of flannel for a dressing-gown,
seven noses of cloth for a pair of breeches, a nose and a half of satin
for a cravat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_577">[577]</span></p>

<p>Let us add, finally, that the Georgian ladies find this more convenient
than European measures.</p>

<h4><i>FANFRELUCHE</i></h4>

<p class="p1">To write in praise of this marvelous lap-dog, one should pluck a quill

<p>His name was Fanfreluche, a pretty name for a dog, and one that he bore
with honor.</p>

<p>Fanfreluche was no larger than his mistress’s hand, and it is well
known that the marquise has the smallest hand in the world; and yet he
seemed larger to the eye, assuming almost the proportions of a small
sheep, for he had silky hair a foot in length, and so fine and soft and
lustrous that the tresses of Minette were a mere mop by contrast. When
he presented his paw, and one pressed it a little, one was astonished
to feel nothing at all. Fanfreluche was rather a ball of silk, from
which two beautiful brown eyes and a little red nose glittered, than an
actual dog. Such a dog could only have belonged to the mother of Love,
who lost him in Cytherea, where the marquise, on one of her occasional
visits, found him. Look for a moment at this fascinatingly exquisite
face. Would not Roxalana herself have been jealous of that delicately
tipped-up nose, divided in the middle by a little furrow just like Anne
of Austria’s?</p>

<p>What vivacity in that quick eye! And that double row of white teeth,
no larger than grains of rice, which, at the least emotion, sparkled
in all their brilliance&mdash;what duchess would not envy them? And this
charming Fanfreluche, apart from his physical attractions, possessed
a thousand social graces: he danced the minuet with exquisite grace,
knew how to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_578">[578]</span> his paw and tell the hour, capered before the queen
and great ladies of France, and distinguished his right paw from his
left. And Fanfreluche was learned, and knew more than the members of
the Academy. If he was not a member of that body it was because he did
not desire it, thinking, no doubt, to shine rather by his absence. The
abbé declared that he was as strong as a Turk in the dead languages,
and that, if he did not talk, it was from pure malice and to vex his
mistress.</p>

<p>Then, too, Fanfreluche had not the vivacity of common dogs. He was
very dainty, and very hard to please. He absolutely refused to eat
anything but little pies of calves’ brains made especially for him;
he would drink nothing but cream from a little Japanese saucer. Only
when his mistress dined in town would he consent to nibble at the wing
of a chicken, and to take sweets for dessert; but he did not grant
this favor to every one, and one had to have an excellent cook to gain
it. Fanfreluche had only one little fault. But who is perfect in this
world? He loved cherries in brandy and Spanish snuff, of which he took
a little pinch from time to time. But the latter is a weakness he
shared with the Prince of Condé.</p>

<p>When he heard the cover of the general’s golden snuff-box click, it
was a treat to see him sit up on his little hind legs and brush the
carpet with his silken tail; and, if the marquise was engrossed in the
pleasures of whist, and did not watch him closely, he would jump on the
abbé’s lap, who fed him with brandied cherries. And Fanfreluche, whose
head was not strong, would become as tipsy as a Swiss guard and two
choristers, would perform the queerest little tricks on the carpet, and
become extraordinarily ferocious on the subject of the calves of the
chevalier, who, to preserve what little was left of them, would draw
up his legs on his chair. Then Fanfreluche was no longer a little dog,
but a little lion, and the marquise alone could manage him. His picture
would not be complete without mentioning the droll little naughtinesses
that he was guilty of before being stowed away into his muff, and put
to bed in his niche of rosewood, padded with white satin and edged with
blue silk cord.</p>

<h4><i>THE GOOD FLEA AND THE WICKED KING</i></h4>

<p class="p1">Once upon a time there was a wicked king, who made his people very
unhappy. Everybody detested him, and those whom he had put in prison
and beheaded would have liked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_581">[581]</span> to whip him. But how? He was the
strongest, he was the master, he did not have to give account to any
one, and when he was told his subjects were not content, he replied:</p>

<p>“Well, what of it? I don’t care a rap!” Which was an ugly answer.</p>

<p>As he continued to act like a king, and as every day he became a little
more wicked than the day before, this set a certain little flea to
thinking over the matter. It was a little bit of a flea, who was of no
consequence at all, but full of good sentiments. This is not the nature
of fleas in general; but this one had been very well brought up; it bit
people with moderation, and only when it was very hungry.</p>

<p>“What if I were to bring the king to reason?” it said to itself. “It is
not without danger. But no matter&mdash;I will try.”</p>

<p>That night the wicked king, after having done all sorts of naughty
things during the day, was calmly going to sleep when he felt what
seemed to be the prick of a pin.</p>

<p>“Bite!”</p>

<p>He growled, and turned over on the other side.</p>

<p>“Bite! Bite! Bite!”</p>

<p>“Who is it that bites me so?” cried the king in a terrible voice.</p>

<p>“It is I,” replied a very little voice.</p>

<p>“You? Who are you?”</p>

<p>“A little flea who wishes to correct you.”</p>

<p>“A flea? Just you wait! Just you wait, and you shall see!”</p>

<p>And the king sprang from his bed, twisted his coverings, and shook the
sheets, all of which was quite useless, for the good flea had hidden
itself in the royal beard.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the king, “it has gone now, and I shall be able to get a
sound sleep.”</p>

<p>But scarcely had he laid his head on the pillow, when&mdash;</p>

<p>“Bite!”</p>

<p>“How? What? Again?”</p>

<p>“Bite! Bite!”</p>

<p>“You dare to return, you abominable little flea? Think for a moment
what you are doing! You are no bigger than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_582">[582]</span> a grain of sand, and you
dare to bite one of the greatest kings on earth!”</p>

<p>“Well, what of it? I don’t care a rap!” answered the flea in the very
words of the king.</p>

<p>“Ah, if I only had you!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you haven’t got me!”</p>

<p>The wicked king did not sleep all that night, and he arose the next
morning in a killing ill humor. He resolved to destroy his enemy.
By his orders, they cleaned the palace from top to bottom, and
particularly his bedroom; his bed was made by ten old women very
skilful in the art of catching fleas. But they caught nothing, for the
good flea had hidden itself under the collar of the king’s coat.</p>

<p>That night, this frightful tyrant, who was dying for want of sleep, lay
back on both his ears, though this is said to be very difficult. But he
wished to sleep double, and he knew no better way. I wish you may find
a better. Scarcely had he put out his light, when he felt the flea on
his neck.</p>

<p>“Bite! Bite!”</p>

<p>“Ah, zounds! What is this?”</p>

<p>“It is I&mdash;the flea of yesterday.”</p>

<p>“But what do you want, you rascal&mdash;you tiny pest?”</p>

<p>“I wish you to obey me, and to make your people happy.”</p>

<p>“Ho, there, my soldiers, my captain of the guard, my ministers, my
generals! Everybody! The whole lot of you!”</p>

<p>The whole lot of them came in. The king was in a rage, which made
everybody tremble. He found fault with all the servants of the palace.
Everybody was in consternation. During this time the flea, quite calm,
kept itself hid in the king’s nightcap.</p>

<p>The guards were doubled; laws and decrees were made; ordinances were
published against all fleas; there were processions and public prayers
to ask of Heaven the extermination of the flea, and sound sleep for the
king. It was all of no avail. The wretched king could not lie down,
even on the grass, without being attacked by his obstinate enemy, the
good flea, who did not let him sleep a single minute.</p>

<p>“Bite! Bite!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_583">[583]</span></p>

<p>It would take too long to tell the many hard knocks the king gave
himself in trying to crush the flea; he was covered with bruises and
contusions. As he could not sleep, he wandered about like an uneasy
spirit. He grew thinner. He would certainly have died if, at last, he
had not made up his mind to obey the good flea.</p>

<p>“I surrender,” he said at last, when it began to bite him again. “I ask
for quarter. I will do what you wish.”</p>

<p>“So much the better. On that condition only shall you sleep,” replied
the flea.</p>

<p>“Thank you. What must I do?”</p>

<p>“Make your people happy!”</p>

<p>“I have never learned how. I do not know how&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Nothing more easy: you have only to go away.”</p>

<p>“Taking my treasures with me?”</p>

<p>“Without taking anything.”</p>

<p>“But I shall die if I have no money,” said the king.</p>

<p>“Well, what of it? I don’t care!” replied the flea.</p>

<p>But the flea was not hard-hearted, and it let the king fill his pockets
with money before he went away. And the people were able to be very
happy by setting up a republic.</p>

<p>Alphonse Daudet, humorist and story writer, created the character of
Tartarin, a gasconading humbug, and a satire on the typical character
attributed to Southern France.</p>

<p>A bit from <i>Tartarin in the Alps</i> will show the type of humor.</p>


<h4><i>WILLIAM TELL</i></h4>

<p class="p1">The party of travelers now came to the Lake of Lucerne, with its dark
waters overshadowed by high and menacing mountains. To their right they
saw that Ruetli meadow where Melchthal, Fuerst, and Stauffacher had
sworn the oath to deliver their country.</p>

<p>Tartarin, deeply moved, took off his cap, and even threw it into the
air three times to render homage to the shades of the departed heroes.
Some of the tourists mistook this for a salutation, and bowed in
return. At last they reached Tell’s Chapel. This chapel is situated at
the edge of the lake, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_584">[584]</span> the very rock upon which, during the storm,
William Tell jumped from Gessler’s boat. And it was a delicious emotion
to Tartarin, while he followed the travelers along the lake, to tread
this historic ground, to recall and revive the various scenes of this
great drama, which he knew as well as his own biography.</p>

<p>For William Tell had always been his ideal man. When at Bézuquet’s
pharmacy the game of Preferences was being played, and each one wrote
on his slip of paper the name of the poet, the tree, the odor, the
hero, and the woman that he preferred to all others of their kind, one
slip invariably bore this inscription:</p>

<p>“Favorite tree?&mdash;The baobab.</p>

<p>“Favorite odor?&mdash;Gunpowder.</p>

<p>“Favorite author?&mdash;Fenimore Cooper.</p>

<p>“Who would you like to have been?&mdash;William Tell.”</p>

<p>And then everybody would exclaim, “That’s Tartarin!”</p>

<p>Imagine, then, how happy he was, and how his heart beat when he stood
before the chapel commemorative of the gratitude of a whole nation. It
seemed to him as if William Tell must come in person to open the door,
still dripping from the waters of the lake, and holding in his hand his
bolts and crossbow.</p>

<p>“Don’t come in here. I’m working. This is not the day on which tourists
are allowed,” sounded a strong voice from the interior, reechoing
against the walls.</p>

<p>“M. Astier-Réhu, of the French Academy!”</p>

<p>“Herr Professor Doctor Schwanthaler!”</p>

<p>“Tartarin of Tarascon!”</p>

<p>The painter, who was standing on a scaffolding within, stretched out
half of his body clad in his working-blouse, and holding his palette in
his hand.</p>

<p>“My pupil will come down and open the door for you, gentlemen,” he said
in a respectful tone.</p>

<p>“I was sure of it; of course,” said Tartarin to himself, “I have only
to mention my name.”</p>

<p>For all that, he had the good taste to fall into line and modestly
enter the chapel behind the others.</p>

<p>The painter, a splendid fellow, with a magnificent golden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_585">[585]</span> head of
an artist of the Renaissance, received his visitors on the wooden
staircase which led to the temporary scaffolding from which the mural
paintings were being done. All the frescos, representing scenes from
Tell’s life, were complete, except the one in which the scene of
the apple at Altorf was to be shown. Upon that the painter was now
working....</p>

<p>“I find it all very characteristically done,” said the great
Astier-Réhu.</p>

<p>And Schwanthaler, folding his arms, recited two of Schiller’s verses,
half of which was lost in his beard. Then the ladies delivered their
opinions, and for some minutes one would have thought oneself in a
confectioner’s shop. “Beautiful!” they cried. “Lovely! Exquisite!
Delicious!”</p>

<p>Suddenly came a voice, tearing the silence like a trumpet’s blare:</p>

<p>“Badly shouldered, that blunderbuss, I tell you! He never held it in
that way!”</p>

<p>Imagine the stupefaction of the painter when this tourist, stick in
hand and bundle on his back, undertook to demonstrate to him as clearly
as that two and two are four, that the position of Tell in the picture
was incorrect.</p>

<p>“And I understand these matters, I would have you know!”</p>

<p>“And who are you?”</p>

<p>“Who am I?” said our Tarasconian hero, deeply astonished. And so it
was not at his name that the door had opened. Drawing himself up, he
answered, “Ask the panthers of Zaccar, or the lions of Atlas, and
perhaps they will answer you.”</p>

<p>Every one drew away from Tartarin in fright and consternation.</p>

<p>“But then,” asked the painter, “in what respect is Tell’s position
incorrect?”</p>

<p>“Look at me!”</p>

<p>Falling back with a double step that made the planks creak, Tartarin,
using his cane to represent the “blunderbuss,” threw himself into
position.</p>

<p>“Superb! He is right! Don’t move!” cried the painter. Then to his pupil:</p>

<p>“Quick, bring me paper and charcoal!”</p>

<h3>GERMAN HUMOR</h3></div>


<p>Christian F. Gellert, a German poet of the early Eighteenth century,

        <div>And calling him “My dear,”</div>

        <div>Of him he asked, “Pray, who lies buried here?”</div>
        <div>The sexton waited long, and seemed quite shy</div>
        <div>Of making any sort of a reply.</div>
        <div>“Well,” he began at last with mournful sigh,</div>
        <div>“The Lord forgive him, ’twas a man</div>

        <div>Whom scarcely they allowed a decent grave;</div>

        <div>A heretic, and, what is worse,</div>

        <div>And without fear of contradiction,</div>

<p>Gotthold Ephraim Lessing was a celebrated German dramatist and critic.
His collected works fill many volumes.</p>

<p>We quote a few of his Fables and Epigrams.</p>


<h4><i>THE RAVEN</i></h4>

<p class="p1">The raven remarked that the eagle sat thirty days upon her eggs. “That,
undoubtedly,” said she, “is the reason why the young of the eagle are
so all-seeing and strong. Good! I will do the same.”</p>

<p>And, since then, the raven actually sits thirty days upon
her eggs; but, as yet, she has hatched nothing but miserable
ravens.&mdash;<i>Fables.</i></p>


<h4><i>THE DECORATED BOW</i></h4>

<p class="p1">A man had an excellent bow of ebony, with which he shot very far and
very sure, and which he valued at a great price. But once, after
considering it attentively, he said:</p>

<p>“A little too rude still! Your only ornament is your polish. It is a
pity! However, that can be remedied,” thought he. “I will go and let a
first-rate artist carve something on the bow.”</p>

<p>He went, and the artist carved an entire hunting-scene upon the bow.
And what more fitting for a bow than a hunting-scene?</p>

<p>The man was delighted. “You deserve this embellishment, my beloved
bow.” So saying, he wished to try it.</p>

<p>He drew the string. The bow broke!&mdash;<i>Fables.</i></p>

<h4><i>A HORSE TIED TO A STEEPLE</i></h4>

<p class="p1">I set off from Rome on a journey to Russia, in the midst of winter,
from a just notion that frost and snow must of course improve the
roads, which every traveler had described as uncommonly bad through
the northern parts of Germany, Poland, Courland, and Livonia. I went
on horseback, as the most convenient manner of traveling. I was but
lightly clothed, and of this I felt the inconvenience the more I
advanced northeast. What must not a poor old man have suffered in that
severe weather and climate, whom I saw on a bleak common in Poland,
lying on the road, helpless, shivering,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_590">[590]</span> and hardly having wherewithal
to cover his nakedness? I pitied the poor soul. Though I felt the
severity of the atmosphere myself, I threw my mantle over him, and
immediately I heard a voice from the heavens, blessing me for that
piece of charity, saying:</p>

<p>“You will be rewarded, my son, for this in time.”</p>

<p>I went on. Night and darkness overtook me. No village was to be seen.
The country was covered with snow, and I was unacquainted with the road.</p>

<p>Tired out, I alighted, and fastened my horse to something like the
pointed stump of a tree which appeared above the snow. For the sake
of safety I placed my pistols under my arm, and laid down on the
snow, where I slept so soundly that I did not open my eyes till full
daylight. It is not easy to conceive my astonishment at finding myself
in the midst of a village, lying in a churchyard. Nor was my horse
to be seen; but I heard him soon after neigh somewhere above me. On
looking upward, I beheld him hanging by his bridle to the weathercock
of the steeple. Matters were now quite plain to me. The village had
been covered with snow overnight; a sudden change in the weather had
taken place; I had sunk down to the churchyard while asleep at the same
rate as the snow had melted away; and what in the dark I had taken to
be a stump of a little tree appearing above the snow, to which I had
tied my horse, proved to have been the cross or weathercock of the
steeple!</p>

<p>Without long consideration, I took one of my pistols, shot the
bridle in two, brought down the horse, and proceeded on my
journey.&mdash;<i>Adventures of Baron Münchausen.</i></p>


<h4><i>A RATHER LARGE WHALE</i></h4>

<p class="p1">I embarked at Portsmouth, in a first-rate English man-of-war of one
hundred guns and fourteen hundred men, for North America. Nothing worth
relating happened till we arrived within three hundred leagues of the
river St. Lawrence, when the ship struck with amazing force against (as
we supposed) a rock. However, upon heaving the lead, we could find no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_591">[591]</span>
bottom, even with three hundred fathoms. What made this circumstance
the more wonderful, and indeed beyond all comprehension, was, that
the violence of the shock was such that we lost our rudder, broke our
bowsprit in the middle, and split all our masts from top to bottom,
two of which went by the board. A poor fellow, who was aloft furling
the main-sheet, was flung at least three leagues from the ship; but
he fortunately saved his life by laying hold of the tail of a large
sea-gull, which brought him back and lodged him on the very spot whence
he was thrown. Another proof of the violence of the shock was the force
with which the people between decks were driven against the floors
above them. My head particularly was pressed into my stomach, where it
continued some months before it returned to its natural situation.</p>

<p>While we were all in a state of astonishment at the general and
unaccountable confusion in which we were involved, the whole was
suddenly explained by the appearance of a large whale, which had been
basking, asleep, within sixteen feet of the surface of the water. This
animal was so much displeased with the disturbance which our ship had
given him&mdash;for in our passage we had with our rudder scratched his
nose&mdash;that he beat in all the gallery and part of the quarter-deck with
his tail, and almost at the same instant took the main-sheet anchor,
which was suspended, as it usually is, from the head, between his
teeth, and ran away with the ship at least sixty leagues, at the rate
of twelve leagues an hour, when, fortunately, the cable broke, and we
lost both the whale and the anchor. However, upon our return to Europe,
some months after, we found the same whale within a few leagues of the
same spot, floating dead upon the water. It measured above half a mile
in length. As we could take only a small quantity of such a monstrous
animal on board, we got our boats out, and with much difficulty cut off
his head, where, to our great joy, we found the anchor, and above forty
fathoms of the cable, concealed on the left side of his mouth, just
under his tongue. Perhaps this was the cause of his death, as that side
of his tongue was much swelled with severe inflammation.</p>

<p>This was the only extraordinary circumstance that happened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_592">[592]</span> on this
voyage. One part of our distress, however, I had like to have forgot.
While the whale was running away with the ship she sprang a leak, and
the water poured in so fast that all our pumps could not keep us from
sinking. It was, however, my good fortune to discover it first. I found
a large hole about a foot in diameter, and you will naturally suppose
this circumstance gives me infinite pleasure, when I inform you that
this noble vessel was preserved, with all its crew, by a most happy
thought of mine. In short I sat down over it, and could have covered
it had it been even larger. Nor will you be surprised at this when I
inform you that I am descended from Dutch parents.</p>

<p>My situation, while I sat there, was rather cool, but the carpenter’s
art soon relieved me.</p>

        <div>Pulled forth the wedge, and the trunk closed again.</div>
        <div>By head and foot was Bruin firmly caught,</div>
        <div>Nor threats nor flatt’ry could avail him aught.</div>
        <div>He howled, he raved, he struggled, and he tore,</div>
        <div>Till the whole place re-echoed with his roar,</div>
        <div>And Goodman Joiner, wakened by the rout,</div>
        <div>Jumped up, much wond’ring what ’twas all about.</div>
        <div>He seized his ax, that he might be prepared,</div>
        <div>And danger, if it came, might find him on his guard.</div>
        <div class="i1">Still howled the Bear, and struggled to get free</div>
        <div>From the accursed grip of that cleft tree.</div>
        <div>He strove and strained, but strained and strove in vain;</div>
        <div>His mightiest efforts but increased his pain;</div>
        <div>He thought he never should get loose again.</div>
        <div>And Reynard thought the same, for his own part,</div>
        <div>And wished it, too, devoutly from his heart</div>
        <div>And as the joiner coming he espied,</div>
        <div>Armed with his ax, the jesting ruffian cried:</div>
        <div class="i1">“Uncle, what cheer? Is th’ honey to your taste?</div>
        <div>Don’t eat too quick; there’s no such need of haste.</div>
        <div>The joiner’s coming, and I make no question,</div>
        <div>He brings you your dessert, to help digestion.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_599">[599]</span></div>
        <div class="i1">Then, deeming ’twas not longer safe to stay,</div>
        <div>To Malepartus back he took his way.</div>
      </div>

<p>The brothers, Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm, wrote much in collaboration
beside their well-known <i>Märchen</i> or <i>Fairy Tales</i>.</p>

<p>Their humor is of the heavier sort, but their versatile erudition found
opportunities for witty conceits.</p>


<h4><i>EXCERPT FROM CLEVER GRETHEL</i></h4>

<p class="p1">One day her master said to her, “Grethel, I have invited some friends
to dinner to-day; cook me some of your best chickens.”</p>

<p>“That I will, master,” she replied.</p>

<p>So she went out, and killed two of the best fowls and prepared them for
roasting.</p>

<p>In the afternoon she placed them on the spit before the fire, and they
were all ready, and beautifully hot and brown by the proper time, but
the visitors had not arrived. So she went to her master, and said, “The
fowls will be quite spoiled if I keep them at the fire any longer. It
will be a pity and a shame if they are not eaten soon!”</p>

<p>Then said her master, “I will go and fetch the visitors myself,” and
away he went.</p>

<p>As soon as his back was turned Grethel put the spit with the birds on
one side, and thought, “I have been standing by the fire so long that
it has made me quite thirsty. Who knows when they will come? While I
am waiting I may as well run into the cellar and have a little drop.”
So she seized a jug, and said, “All right, Grethel, you shall have a
good draft. Wine is so tempting!” she continued, “and it does not do
to spoil your draft.” And she drank without stopping till the jug was
empty.</p>

<p>After this she went into the kitchen, and placed the fowls again before
the fire, basted them with butter, and rattled the spit round so
furiously that they browned and frizzled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_608">[608]</span> with the heat. “They would
never miss a little piece if they searched for it ever so carefully,”
she said to herself. Then she dipped her finger in the dripping-pan
to taste, and cried, “Oh, how nice these fowls are! It is a sin and a
shame that there is no one here to eat them!”</p>

<p>She ran to the window to see if her master and the guests were coming;
but she could see no one. So she went and stood again by the fowls, and
thought, “The wing of that fowl is a little burned. I had better eat it
out of the way.” She cut it off as she thought this, and ate it up, and
it tasted so nice that when she had finished it she thought, “I must
have the other. Master will never notice that anything is missing.”</p>

<p>After the two wings were eaten, Grethel again went to look for her
master, but there were no signs of his appearance.</p>

<p>“Who knows?” she said to herself; “perhaps the visitors are not coming
at all, and they have kept my master to dinner, so he won’t be back.
Hi, Grethel! there are lots of good things left for you; and that piece
of fowl has made me thirsty. I must have another drink before I come
back and eat up all these good things.”</p>

<p>So she went into the cellar, took a large draft of wine, and returning
to the kitchen, sat down and ate the remainder of the fowl with great
relish.</p>

<p>There was now only one fowl left, and as her master did not return,
Grethel began to look at the other with longing eyes. At last she said,
“Where one is, there the other must be; for the fowls belong to each
other, and what is right for one is also fair and right for the other.
I believe, too, I want some more to drink. It won’t hurt me.”</p>

<p>The last draft gave her courage. She came back to the kitchen and let
the second fowl go after the first.</p>

<p>As she was enjoying the last morsel, home came her master.</p>

<p>“Make haste, Grethel!” he cried. “The guests will be here in a few
minutes.”</p>

<p>“Yes, master,” she replied. “It will soon be all ready.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the master saw that the cloth was laid and everything in
order. So he took up the carving-knife with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_609">[609]</span> which he intended to carve
the fowl, and went out to sharpen it on the stones in the passage.</p>

<p>While he was doing so, the guests arrived and knocked gently and
courteously at the house door. Grethel ran out to see who it was, and
when she caught sight of the visitors she placed her finger on her
lips, and whispered, “Hush! Hush! Go back again as quickly as you came!
If my master should catch you it would be unfortunate. He did invite
you to dinner this evening, but with no other intention than to cut off
both the ears of each of you. Listen; you can hear him sharpening his
knife.”</p>

<p>The guests heard the sound, and hastened as fast as they could down the
steps, and were soon out of sight.</p>

<p>Grethel was not idle. She ran screaming to her master, and cried, “You
have invited fine visitors, certainly!”</p>

<p>“Hi! Why, Grethel, what do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” she exclaimed, “they came here just now, and have taken my two
beautiful fowls from the dish that I was going to bring up for dinner,
and have run away with them.”</p>

<p>“What strange conduct!” said her master, who was so sorry to lose his
nice dinner that he rushed out to follow the thieves. “If they had only
left me one, or at least enough for my own dinner!” he cried, running
after them. But the more he cried to them to stop the faster they
ran; and when they saw him with the knife in his hand, and heard him
say, “Only one! only one!”&mdash;he meant, if they had left him “only one
fowl,” but they thought he spoke of “only one ear,” which he intended
to cut off&mdash;they ran as if fire were burning around them, and were
not satisfied till they found themselves safe at home with both ears
untouched.</p>

<h4><i>THE TOWN OF GÖTTINGEN</i></h4>

<p class="p1">The town of Göttingen, famous by reason of its university and its
sausages, belongs to the kingdom of Hanover, and contains 999
fire-stations, divers churches, a lying-in hospital, an observatory,
an academic prison, a library, and an underground tavern&mdash;where the
beer is excellent. The brook that flows past the town is called the
Leine, and serves for bathing in summer; the water is very cold, and
at some places the brook is so wide that one cannot jump across it
without some exertion. The town is very handsome, and pleases me best
when my back is turned to it. It must be very old, for I remember that
when I matriculated (and was soon afterward rusticated), five years
ago, it had the same gray, ancient appearance, and was as thoroughly
provided, as it is now, with poodle dogs, dissertations, laundresses,
anthologies, roast pigeon, Guelph decorations, pipe-bowls, court
councilors, privy councilors and silly counts....</p>

<p>In general, the inhabitants of Göttingen may be divided into students,
professors, Philistines, and cattle. The cattle class is numerically
the strongest. To place on record here the names of all professors
and students would take me too far afield, nor can I even, at this
moment, remember the name of every student; while among the professors
there are many who have as yet made none. The number of Philistines in
Göttingen must be like that of the sands&mdash;or rather the mud&mdash;of the
sea. Truly, when they appear in the morning with their dirty faces and
their white bills at the gates of the academic court, one wonders how
God could have had the heart to create such a pack of scoundrels!</p>

<p>More thorough information concerning Göttingen is easily obtainable by
reference to the “Topography” of the town, by K. F. H. Marx. Although
I am under the deepest obligations to the author, who was my physician
and did me many kindnesses, I cannot praise his work without reserve. I
must blame him for not having opposed in terms sufficiently strong the
heresy that the ladies of Göttingen have feet of spacious dimensions.
I have been engaged for a long time upon a work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_612">[612]</span> which is to destroy
this erroneous idea once and forever. For this purpose I have studied
comparative anatomy, have made excerpts from the rarest books in the
library, and have for hours and hours observed the feet of the passing
ladies in Weender Street. In my learned treatise I intend to deal with
the subject as follows:</p>

<ul class="smaller">
  <li>1. Of Feet in General.</li>
  <li>2. Of the Feet of the Ancients.</li>
  <li>3. Of the Feet of Elephants.</li>
  <li>4. Of the Feet of the Fair Inhabitants of Göttingen.</li>
  <li class="hangingindent">5. Summing up of Opinions delivered upon Feet in Göttingen Taverns.</li>
  <li class="hangingindent">6. Connection and Comparison of Feet with Calves, Knees, etc.</li>
  <li class="hangingindent">7. Facsimile Charts (if sheets of paper sufficiently large are obtainable) of Specimen Feet of Göttingen Ladies.</li>

<p>I am the most peaceable of mortals. My wishes are: A modest dwelling, a
thatched roof, but a good bed, good fare, milk and butter (the latter
very fresh), flowers at the window, and a few fine trees before my
gate. And if the Lord would fill the cup of my happiness, He would let
me live to see the day when six or seven of my enemies are hung on the
trees. With softened heart I would then forgive them all the evil they
have done me. Yes, one must forgive one’s enemies, but not before they
are hung.</p>

<h3>ITALIAN HUMOR</h3></div>

<p>The humorists of Italy in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries are
few and far between. Carlo Goldoni and Count Carlo Gozzi were both
dramatists, the latter also a novelist, whose works show humor, but are
not available for quotation.</p>

<p>Count Giacomo Leopardi, though himself a gloomy sort of person, left
some satirical writings tinged with wit.</p>


<h4><i>THE ACADEMY OF SYLLOGRAPHS</i></h4>

<p class="p1">The Academy of Syllographs, hold that it would be in the highest
degree expedient that men should retire as far as possible from the
conduct of the business of the world, and should gradually give
place to mechanical agency for the direction of human affairs.
Accordingly, resolved to contribute as far as lies in its power to this
consummation, it has determined to offer three prizes, to be awarded to
the persons who shall invent the best examples of the three machines
now to be described.</p>

<p>The scope and object of the first of these automata shall be to
represent the person and discharge the functions of a friend who shall
not calumniate or jeer at his absent associate; who shall not fail to
take his part when he hears him censured or ridiculed; who shall not
prefer a reputation for wit, and the applause of men, to his duty to
friendship; who shall never, from love of gossip or mere ostentation
of superior knowledge, divulge a secret committed to his keeping; who
shall not abuse the intimacy or confidence of his fellow in order to
supplant or surpass him; who shall harbor no envy against his friend;
who shall guard his interests and help to repair his losses, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_617">[617]</span>
shall be prompt to answer his call, and minister to his needs more
substantially than by empty professions.</p>

<p>In the construction of this piece of mechanism it will be well to
study, among other things, the treatise on friendship by Cicero, as
well as that of Madame de Lambert. The Academy is of opinion that the
manufacture of such a machine ought not to prove impracticable or even
particularly difficult, for, besides the automata of Regiomontanus
and Vaucanson, there was at one time exhibited in London a mechanical
figure which drew portraits, and wrote to dictation; while there have
been more than one example of such machines capable of playing at
chess. Now, in the opinion of many philosophers human life is but a
game; nay, some hold that it is more shallow and more frivolous than
many other games, and that the principles of chess, for example, are
more in accordance with reason, and that its various moves are more
governed by wisdom, than are the actions of mankind; while we have it
on the authority of Pindar that human action is no more substantial
than the shadow of a dream; and this being so, the intelligence of an
automaton ought to prove quite equal to the discharge of the functions
which have just been described.</p>

<p>As to the power of speech, it seems unreasonable to doubt that men
should have the power of communicating it to machines constructed by
themselves, seeing that this may be said to have been established by
sundry precedents, such, for example, as in the case of the statue
of Memnon, and of the human head manufactured by Albertus Magnus,
which actually became so loquacious that Saint Thomas Aquinas, losing
all patience with it, smashed it to pieces. Then, too, there was the
instance of the parrot Ver-Vert, though it was a living creature; but
if it could be taught to converse reasonably how much more may it be
supposed that a machine devised by the mind of man, and constructed
by his hands, should do as much; while it would have this advantage
that it might be made less garrulous than this parrot, or the head of
Albertus, and therefore it need not irritate its acquaintances and
provoke them to smash it.</p>

<p>The inventor of the best example of such a machine shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_618">[618]</span> be decorated
with a gold medallion of four hundred sequins in weight, bearing on its
face the images of Pylades and Orestes, and on the reverse the name of
the successful competitor, surrounded by the legend, <span class="smcap">First Realizer
of the Fables of Antiquity</span>.</p>

<p>The second machine called for by the Academy is to be an artificial
steam man, so constructed and regulated as to perform virtuous and
magnanimous actions. The Academy is of opinion that in the absence of
all other adequate motive power to that end, the properties of steam
might prove effective to inspire an automaton, and direct it to the
attainment of virtue and true glory. The inventor who shall undertake
the construction of such a machine should study the poets and the
writers of romance, who will best guide him as to the qualities and
functions most essential to such a piece of mechanism. The prize shall
be a gold medal weighing four hundred and fifty sequins, bearing on its
obverse a figure symbolical of the golden age, and on its reverse the
name of the inventor.</p>

<p>The third automaton should be so constituted as to perform the duties
of woman such as she was conceived by the Count Baldassar Castiglione,
and described by him in his treatise entitled <i>The Courtier</i>, as
well as by other writers in other works on the subject, which will be
readily found, and which, as well as that of the count, will have to
be carefully consulted and followed. The construction of a machine
of this nature, too, ought not to appear impossible to the inventors
of our time, when they reflect on the fact that in the most ancient
times, and times destitute of science, Pygmalion was able to fabricate
for himself, with his own hands, a wife of such rare gifts that she
has never since been equaled down to the present day. The successful
inventor of this machine shall be rewarded with a gold medal weighing
five hundred sequins, bearing on one face the figure of the Arabian
Phenix of Metastasio, couched on a tree of a European species, while
its other side will bear the name of the inventor, with the title,
<span class="smcap">Inventor of Faithful Women and of Conjugal Happiness</span>.</p>

<p>Finally, the Academy has resolved that the funds necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_619">[619]</span> to defray
the expenses incidental to this competition shall be supplemented by
all that was found in the purse of Diogenes, its first secretary,
together with one of the three golden asses which were the property
of three of its former members&mdash;namely, Apuleius, Firenzuola, and
Machiavelli, but which came into the possession of the Academy by the
last wills and testaments of the aforementioned, as duly recorded in
its minutes.</p>

almost obtuse up to the age of eighteen&mdash;a period of incubation, when
he begins to feel in his nose the first thrills of his fatal vocation.</p>

<p>After that his intellect&mdash;limited even then&mdash;ceases its development
altogether; but his nasal organ, in revenge, assumes colossal
dimensions.</p>

<p>At twenty he buys his first clarinet for fourteen francs; and three
months later his landlord gives him notice. At twenty-five he is
admitted into the band of the National Guard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_620">[620]</span></p>

<p>He dies of a broken heart on finding that not one of his three sons
shows the slightest inclination for the instrument through which he has
blown all his wits.</p>


<h5><i>The Trombone</i></h5>

<p>The man who plays on this instrument is always one who seeks oblivion
in its society&mdash;oblivion of domestic troubles, or consolation for love
betrayed.</p>

<p>The man who has held a metal tube in his mouth for six months finds
himself proof against every illusion.</p>

<p>At the age of fifty he finds that, of all human passions and feelings,
nothing is left him but an insatiable thirst.</p>

<p>Later on, if he wants to obtain the position of porter in a gentleman’s
house, or aspires to the hand of a woman with a delicate ear, he tries
to lay aside his instrument, but the taste for loud notes and strong
liquors only leaves him with life.</p>


<h5><i>The Harmoniflute</i></h5>

<p>This instrument, on account of the nature of its monotonous sounds and
its tremendous plaintiveness, acts on the nerves of those who hear it,
and predisposes to melancholy those who play it.</p>

<p>The harmoniflautist is usually tender and lymphatic of constitution,
with blue eyes, and eats only white meats and farinaceous food.</p>

<p>If a man, he is called Oscar; those of the other sex are named Adelaide.</p>

<p>At home, he or she is in the habit of bringing out the instrument at
dessert, and dinner being over, and the spirits of the family therefore
more or less cheerfully disposed, will entertain the company with the
“Miserere” in <i>Il Trovatore</i>, or some similar melody.</p>

<p>The harmoniflautist weeps easily. After practising on the instrument
for fifteen years or so, he or she dissolves altogether, and is
converted into a brook.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_621">[621]</span></p>


<h5><i>The Organ</i></h5>

<p>This complicated and majestic instrument is of a clerical character,
and destined, by its great volume of sound, to drown the flat singing
of clergy and congregation in church.</p>

<p>The organist is usually a person sent into the world for the purpose
of making a great noise without undue expenditure of strength, one who
wants to blow harder than others without wearing out his own bellows.</p>

<p>At forty he becomes the intimate friend of the parish priest, and the
most influential person connected with the church. By dint of repeating
the same refrains every day at matins and vespers, he acquires a
knowledge of Latin, and gets all the anthems, hymns, and masses by
heart. At fifty he marries a devout spinster recommended by the priest.</p>

<p>He makes a kind and good-tempered husband, his only defect in that
capacity being his habit of dreaming out loud on the eve of every
church festival. On Easter Eve, for instance, he nearly always
awakens his wife by intoning, with the full force of his lungs,
<i>Resurrexit</i>. The good woman, thus abruptly aroused, never fails
to answer him with the orthodox <i>Alleluia</i>.</p>

<p>At the age of sixty he becomes deaf, and then begins to think his own
playing perfection. At seventy he usually dies of a broken heart,
because the new priest, who knows not Joseph, instead of asking him
to dine at the principal table with the clergy and other church
authorities, has relegated him to an inferior place, and the society of
the sacristan and the grave-digger.</p>


<h5><i>The Flute</i></h5>

<p>The unhappy man who succumbs to the fascinations of this instrument is
never one who has attained the full development of his intellectual
faculties. He always has a pointed nose, marries a short-sighted woman,
and dies run over by an omnibus.</p>

<p>The flute is the most deadly of all instruments. It requires<span class="pagenum" id="Page_622">[622]</span> a
peculiar conformation and special culture of the thumb-nail, with a
view to those holes which have to be only half closed.</p>

<p>The man who plays the flute frequently adds to his other infirmities a
mania for keeping tame weasels, turtle-doves, or guinea-pigs.</p>


<h5><i>The Violoncello</i></h5>

<p>To play the ’cello, you require to have long, thin fingers; but it is
still more indispensable to have very long hair falling over a greasy
coat-collar.</p>

<p>In case of fire, the ’cellist who sees his wife and his ’cello in
danger will save the latter first.</p>

<p>His greatest satisfaction, as a general thing, is that of “making
the strings weep.” Sometimes, indeed, he succeeds in making his wife
and family do the same thing in consequence of a diet of excessive
frugality. Sometimes, too, he contrives to make people laugh or yawn,
but this, according to him, is the result of atmospheric influences.</p>

<p>He can express, through his loftily attuned strings, all possible
griefs and sorrows, except those of his audience and his creditors.</p>


<h5><i>The Drum</i></h5>

<p>An immense apparatus of wood and sheepskin, full of air and of sinister
presages. In melodrama the roll of the drum serves to announce the
arrival of a fatal personage, an agent of Destiny, in most cases an
ill-used husband. Sometimes this funereal rumbling serves to describe
silence&mdash;sometimes to indicate the depths of the operatic heroine’s
despair.</p>

<p>The drummer is a serious man, possessed with the sense of his high
dramatic mission. He is able, however, to conceal his conscious pride,
and sleep on his instrument when the rest of the orchestra is making
all the noise it can. In such cases he commissions the nearest of his
colleagues to awaken him at the proper moment.</p>

<p>On awaking, he seizes the two drumsticks and begins to beat; but,
should his neighbor forget to rouse him, he prolongs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_623">[623]</span> his slumbers
till the fall of the curtain. Then he shakes himself, perceives that
the opera is over, and rubs his eyes. If it happens that the conductor
reprimands him for his remissness at the <i>attack</i>, he shrugs his
shoulders and replies, “Never mind, the tenor died, all the same. A
roll of the drum, more or less, what difference would it have made?”</p>

<p>Edmondo de Amicis, soldier and writer of books of travel, often gives
amusing descriptions of scenes or incidents.</p>


<h4><i>TOOTH FOR TOOTH</i></h4>

<p class="p1">An English merchant of Mogador was returning to the city on the evening
of a market-day, at the moment when the gate by which he was entering
was barred by a crowd of country people driving camels and asses.
Although the Englishman called out as loud as he could, “Make way!”
an old woman was struck by his horse and knocked down, falling with
her face upon a stone. Ill fortune would have it that in the fall she
broke her last two front teeth. She was stunned for an instant, and
then rose convulsed with rage, and broke out into insults and ferocious
maledictions, following the Englishman to his door. She then went
before the governor, and demanded that in virtue of the law of talion
he should order the English merchant’s two front teeth to be broken.
The governor tried to pacify her, and advised her to pardon the injury;
but she would listen to nothing, and he sent her away with a promise
that she should have justice, hoping that when her anger should be
exhausted she would herself desist from her pursuit. But, three days
having passed, the old woman came back more furious than ever, demanded
justice, and insisted that a formal sentence should be pronounced
against the Christian.</p>

<p>“Remember,” said she to the governor, “thou didst promise me!”</p>

<p>“What!” responded the governor; “dost thou take me for a Christian,
that I should be the slave of my word?”</p>

<p>Every day for a month the old woman, athirst for vengeance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_624">[624]</span> presented
herself at the door of the citadel, and yelled and cursed and made such
a noise, that the governor, to be rid of her, was obliged to yield.
He sent for the merchant, explained the case, the right which the law
gave the woman, the duty imposed upon himself, and begged him to put an
end to the matter by allowing two of his teeth to be removed&mdash;any two,
although in strict justice they should be two incisors. The Englishman
refused absolutely to part with incisors, or eye-teeth, or molars; and
the governor was obliged to send the old woman packing, ordering the
guard not to let her put her foot in the palace again.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said she, “since there are none but degenerate Mussulmans
here, since justice is refused to a Mussulman woman against an infidel
dog, I will go to the sultan, and we shall see whether the prince of
the faithful will deny the law of the Prophet.”</p>

<p>True to her determination, she started on her journey alone, with an
amulet in her bosom, a stick in her hand, and a bag round her neck, and
made on foot the hundred miles which separate Mogador from the sacred
city of the empire. Arrived at Fez, she sought and obtained audience of
the sultan, laid her case before him, and demanded the right accorded
by the Koran, the application of the law of retaliation. The sultan
exhorted her to forgive. She insisted. All the serious difficulties
which opposed themselves to the satisfaction of her petition were laid
before her. She remained inexorable. A sum of money was offered her,
with which she could live in comfort for the rest of her days. She
refused it.</p>

<p>“What do I want with your money?” said she; “I am old, and accustomed
to live in poverty. What I want is the two teeth of the Christian. I
want them; I demand them in the name of the Koran. The sultan, prince
of the faithful, head of our religion, father of his subjects, cannot
refuse justice to a true believer.”</p>

<p>Her obstinacy put the sultan in a most embarrassing position. The
law was formal, and her right incontestable; and the ferment of the
populace, stirred up by the woman’s fanatical declamations, rendered
refusal perilous. The sultan,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_625">[625]</span> who was Abd-er-Rahman, wrote to the
English consul, asking as a favor that he would induce his countryman
to allow two of his teeth to be broken. The merchant answered the
consul that he would never consent. Then the sultan wrote again, saying
that if he would consent he would grant him, in compensation, any
commercial privilege that he chose to ask. This time, touched in his
purse, the merchant yielded. The old woman left Fez, blessing the name
of the pious Abd-er-Rahman, and went back to Mogador, where, in the
presence of many people, the two teeth of the Nazarene were broken.
When she saw them fall to the ground she gave a yell of triumph,
and picked them up with a fierce joy. The merchant, thanks to the
privileges accorded him, made in the two following years so handsome a
fortune that he went back to England toothless, but happy.</p>

        <div>You understand that there they had no hens;</div>

        <div>Fast they increased as any one could wish;</div>

        <div>Because the stranger taught no other way.</div>
        <div>At last the experiment by one was tried&mdash;</div>
        <div>Sagacious man!&mdash;of having his eggs fried.</div>
        <div>And, O! what boundless honors for his pains,</div>

<h3>RUSSIAN HUMOR</h3>
</div>

<p>A glance at Russia in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries shows
the great popularity of the Fable as a means of expressing the wit and
wisdom of the philosophers.</p>

<p>The two greatest Fabulists were Ivan Chemnitzer or Khemnitzer and Ivan
Kryloff.</p>

<p>Alexander Griboyedoff was a writer of comedies.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Ivan Chemnitzer</span><br />
<span class="subhed"><i>THE PHILOSOPHER</i></span></h4>

<p class="p1">A certain rich man, who had heard it was an advantage to have been at
school abroad, sent his son to study in foreign parts. The son, who
was an utter fool, came back more stupid than ever, having been taught
all sorts of elaborate explanations of the simplest things by a lot of
academical windbags. He expressed himself only in scientific terms, so
that no one understood him, and everyone became very tired of him.</p>

<p>One day, while walking along a road, and gazing at the sky in
speculating upon some problem of the universe to which the answer had
never been found (because there was none), the young man stepped over
the edge of a deep ditch. His father, who chanced to be near by, ran
to get a rope. The son, however, sitting at the bottom of the ditch,
began to meditate on the cause of his fall. He concluded that <i>an
earthquake had superinduced a momentary displacement of his corporeal
axis, thus destroying his equilibrium, and, in obedience to the law of
gravity as established by Newton, precipitating him downward until he
encountered an immovable obstacle</i>&mdash;namely, the bottom of the ditch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_632">[632]</span></p>

<p>When his father arrived with the rope, the following dialogue took
place between them:</p>

<p>“I have brought a rope to pull you out with. There, now, hold on tight
to that end, and don’t let go while I pull.”</p>

<p>“A rope? Please inform me what a rope is before you pull.”</p>

<p>“A rope is a thing to get people out of ditches with, when they have
fallen in and can’t get out by themselves.”</p>

<p>“But how is it that no mechanical device has been constructed for that

<h4><i>THE MUSICIANS</i></h4>

<p class="p1">The tricksy monkey, the goat, the ass, and bandy-legged Mishka, the
bear, determined to play a quartet. They provided themselves with the
necessary instruments&mdash;two fiddles, an alto, and a bass. Then they all
settled down under a large tree, with the object of dazzling the world
by their artistic performance. They fiddled away lustily for some time,
but only succeeded in making a noise, and no music.</p>

<p>“Stop, my friends!” said the monkey, “this will not do; our music does
not sound as it ought. It is plain that we are in the wrong positions.
You, Mishka, take your bass and face the alto; I will go opposite the
second fiddle. Then we shall play altogether differently, so that the
very hills and forests will dance.”</p>

<p>So they changed places, and began over again. But they produced only
discords, as before.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment!” exclaimed the ass; “I know what the matter is. We must
get in a row, and then we shall play in tune.”</p>

<p>This advice was acted upon. The four animals placed themselves in a
straight line, and struck up once more.</p>

<p>The quartet was as unmusical as ever. Then they stopped again, and
began squabbling and wrangling about the proper positions to be taken.
It happened that a nightingale came flying by that way, attracted by
their din. They begged the nightingale to solve their difficulty for
them.</p>

<p>“Pray be so kind,” they said, “as to stay a moment, so that we may get
our quartet in order. We have music and we have instruments; only tell
us how to place ourselves.”</p>

<p>To which the nightingale replied:</p>

<p>“To be a musician, one must have a better ear and more intelligence
than any of you. Place yourselves any way you like; it will make no
difference. You will never become musicians.”</p>

<h4><i>FROM KARLCHEN, THE CROCODILE</i></h4>

<p class="p1">At this moment an appalling, I may even say supernatural, shriek
suddenly shook the room. Not knowing what to think, I stood for a
moment rooted to the spot; then, hearing Elyona Ivanovna shrieking,
too, I turned hastily round; and what did I see! I saw&mdash;oh, heavens!&mdash;I
saw the unhappy Ivan Matvyeich in the fearful jaws of the crocodile,
seized across the middle, lifted horizontally in the air, and kicking
despairingly. Then&mdash;a moment&mdash;and he was gone!</p>

<p>I cannot even attempt to describe the agitation of Elyona Ivanovna.
After her first cry she stood for some time as petrified, and stared
at the scene before her, as if indifferently, though her eyes were
starting out of her head; then she suddenly burst into a piercing
shriek. I caught her by the hands. At this moment the keeper, who
until now had also stood petrified with horror, clasped his hands, and
raising his eyes to heaven cried aloud:</p>

<p>“Oh, my crocodile! Oh, mein allerliebstes Karlchen! Mutter! Mutter!
Mutter!”</p>

<p>At this cry the back door opened, and “Mutter,” a red-cheeked, untidy,
elderly woman in a cap, rushed with a yell toward her son.</p>

<p>Then began an awful tumult. Elyona Ivanovna, beside herself, reiterated
one single phrase, “Cut it! Cut it!” and rushed from the keeper to the
“Mutter,” and back to the keeper, imploring them (evidently in a fit
of frenzy) to “cut” something or some one for some reason. Neither the
keeper nor “Mutter” took any notice of either of us; they were hanging
over the tank, and shrieking like stuck pigs.</p>

<p>“He is gone dead; he vill sogleich burst, because he von ganz official
of der government eat up haf!” cried the keeper.</p>

<p>“Unser Karlchen, unser allerliebstes Karlchen wird sterben!” wailed the
mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_636">[636]</span></p>

<p>“Ve are orphans, vitout bread!” moaned the keeper.</p>

<p>“Cut it! Cut it! Cut it open!” screamed Elyona Ivanovna, hanging on to
the German’s coat.</p>

<p>“He did teaze ze crocodile! Vy your man teaze ze crocodile?” yelled the
German, wriggling away. “You vill pay me if Karlchen wird bersten! Das
war mein Sohn, das war mein einziger Sohn!”</p>

<p>“Cut it!” shrieked Elyona Ivanovna.</p>

<p>“How! You vill dat my crocodile shall be die? No, your man shall be
die first, and denn my crocodile. Mein Vater show von crocodile, mein
Grossvater show von crocodile, mein Sohn shall show von crocodile, and
I shall show von crocodile. All ve shall show crocodile. I am ganz
Europa famous, and you are not ganz Europa famous, and you do be me von
fine pay shall!”</p>

<p>“Ja, ja!” agreed the woman savagely; “ve you not let out; fine ven
Karlchen vill bersten.”</p>

<p>“For that matter,” I put in calmly, in the hope of getting Elyona
Ivanovna home without further ado, “there’s no use in cutting it open,
for in all probability our dear Ivan Matvyeich is now soaring in the
empyrean.”</p>

<p>“My dear,” remarked at this moment the voice of Ivan Matvyeich, with
startling suddenness, “my advice, my dear, is to act through the bureau
of police, for the German will not comprehend the truth without the
assistance of the police.”</p>

<p>These words, uttered with firmness and gravity, and expressing
astonishing presence of mind, at first so much amazed us that we could
not believe our ears. Of course, however, we instantly ran to the
crocodile’s tank and listened to the speech of the unfortunate captive
with a mixture of reverence and distrust. His voice sounded muffled,
thin, and even squeaky, as though coming from a long distance.</p>

<p>“Ivan Matvyeich, my dearest, are you alive?” lisped Elyona Ivanovna.</p>

<p>“Alive and well,” answered Ivan Matvyeich; “and, thanks to the
Almighty, swallowed whole without injury. I am only disturbed by
doubt as to how the superior authorities will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_637">[637]</span> regard this episode;
for, after having taken a ticket to go abroad, to go into a crocodile
instead is hardly sensible.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear, don’t worry about sense now; first of all we must somehow
or other dig you out,” interrupted Elyona Ivanovna.</p>

<p>“Tig!” cried the German. “I not vill let you to tig ze crocodile! Now
shall bery mush Publikum be come, and I shall fifety copeck take, and
Karlchen shall leave off to burst.”</p>

<p>“Gott sei Dank!” added the mother.</p>

<p>“They are right,” calmly remarked Ivan Matvyeich; “the economic
principle before everything.”</p>

in His azure palace.</p>

<p>All the virtues were invited. Men He did not ask&mdash;only ladies.</p>

<p>There was a large number of them, great and small. The lesser virtues
were more agreeable and genial than the great ones; but they all
appeared to be in good-humor, and chatted amiably together, as was only
becoming for near relations and friends.</p>

<p>But the Supreme Being noticed two charming ladies who seemed to be
totally unacquainted.</p>

<p>The Host gave one of the ladies His arm, and led her up to the other.</p>

<p>“Beneficence!” He said, indicating the first.</p>

<p>“Gratitude!” He added, indicating the second.</p>

<h3>AMERICAN HUMOR</h3>
</div>

<p>There may have been previous mute, inglorious Miltons, but doubtless
the first American to be recognized as a true humorist was Benjamin
Franklin.</p>

<p>In fact, one of the foremost essayists of the present day opines that
the reason Franklin was not called upon to write the Declaration of
Independence was because he was too fond of his joke.</p>

<p>“They were acute,” our essayist remarks, “those leaders of the
Continental Congress, and they knew that every man has the defect
of his qualities, and that a humorist is likely to be lacking in
reverence, and that the writer of the Declaration of Independence had a
theme which demanded most reverential treatment.”</p>

<p>It is generally conceded that the Americans are a humorous nation, is
even said that we have a way of living humorously, and are conscious of
the fact.</p>

<p>Aside from the annual work known as <i>Poor Richard’s Almanack</i>,
Franklin wrote much prose and verse of a witty character.</p>

<p>A letter of his gave rise to the well known saying, “He paid too much
for his whistle.”</p>

<p>Part of the letter is here given.</p>

<p>“When I was a child of seven years old, my friends on a holiday filled
my pocket with coppers. I went directly to a shop where they sold toys
for children; and, being charmed with the sound of a <i>whistle</i>
that I met by the way in the hands of another boy, I voluntarily
offered and gave all my money for one. I then came home, and went
whistling all over the house, much pleased with my <i>whistle</i>,
but disturbing all the family. My brothers and sisters and cousins,
understanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_644">[644]</span> the bargain I had made, told me I had given four times
as much for it as it was worth; put me in mind what good things I might
have bought with the rest of the money, and laughed at me so much for
my folly, that I cried with vexation; and the reflection gave me more
chagrin than the <i>whistle</i> gave me pleasure.</p>

<p>“This, however, was afterward of use to me, the impression continuing
on my mind, so that often, when I was tempted to buy some unnecessary
thing, I said to myself, <i>Don’t give too much for the whistle</i>;
and I saved my money.</p>

<p>“As I grew up, came into the world, and observed the actions of men,
I thought I met with many, very many, who <i>gave too much for the
whistle</i>.</p>

<p>“When I saw one too ambitious to court favor, sacrificing his time in
attendance on levees, his repose, his liberty, his virtue, and perhaps
his friends, to attain it, I have said to myself, <i>This man gives too
much for his whistle</i>.</p>

<p>“When I saw another fond of popularity, constantly employing himself
in political bustles, neglecting his own affairs and ruining them by
that neglect, <i>He pays, indeed</i>, said I, <i>too much for his
whistle</i>.</p>

<p>“If I knew a miser, who gave up any kind of a comfortable living,
all the pleasure of doing good to others, all the esteem of his
fellow-citizens, and the joys of benevolent friendship, for the sake of
accumulating wealth, <i>Poor man</i>, said I, <i>you pay too much for
your whistle</i>.</p>

<p>“When I met with a man of pleasure, sacrificing every laudable
improvement of the mind, or of his fortune, to mere corporal
sensations, and ruining his health in their pursuit, <i>Mistaken
man</i>, said I, <i>you are providing pain for yourself instead of
pleasure! you give too much for your whistle</i>.</p>

<p>“If I see one fond of appearance, or fine clothes, fine houses,
fine furniture, fine equipages, all above his fortune, for which he
contracts debts, and ends his career in a prison, <i>Alas!</i> say I,
<i>he has paid dear, very dear, for his whistle</i>.</p>

<p>“When I see a beautiful, sweet-tempered girl married to an ill-natured
brute of a husband, <i>What a pity</i>, say I, <i>that she should pay
so much for a whistle</i>!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_645">[645]</span></p>

<p>“In short, I conceive that great part of the miseries of mankind are
brought upon them by the false estimates they have made of the value of
things, and by their <i>giving too much for their whistles</i>.</p>

<p>“Yet I ought to have charity for these unhappy people, when I consider,
that with all this wisdom of which I am boasting, there are certain
things in the world so tempting, for example, the apples of King John,
which happily are not to be bought; for if they were put up to sale by
auction, I might very easily be led to ruin myself in the purchase, and
find that I had once more given too much for the <i>whistle</i>.</p>

<p>“Adieu, my dear friend, and believe me ever yours, very sincerely and
with unalterable affection.”</p>

        <div>“Now, <i>Dasher!</i> now, <i>Dancer!</i> now, <i>Prancer</i> and <i>Vixen!</i></div>
        <div>On, <i>Comet!</i> on, <i>Cupid!</i> on, <i>Dunder</i> and <i>Blitzen!</i></div>

        <div>So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,</div>
        <div>With the sleigh full of Toys, and St. Nicholas too.</div>
        <div>And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof</div>
        <div>The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.</div>
        <div>As I drew in my head, and was turning around,</div>
        <div>Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.</div>
        <div>He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,</div>
        <div>And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;</div>
        <div>A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back,</div>

        <div>His eyes&mdash;how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!</div>
        <div>His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!</div>
        <div>His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,</div>
        <div>And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;</div>
        <div>The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,</div>
        <div>And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath;</div>
        <div>He had a broad face and a little round belly,</div>
        <div>That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly.</div>
        <div>He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,</div>
        <div>And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;</div>
        <div>A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,</div>
        <div>Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;</div>
        <div>He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,</div>
        <div>And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,</div>
        <div>And laying his finger aside of his nose,</div>
        <div>And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;</div>
        <div>He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,</div>
        <div>And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.</div>
        <div>But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,</div>
        <div><i>“Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night</i>.”</div>

<p>Seba Smith, among the first to break away from English traditions,

<h4><i>MY FIRST VISIT TO PORTLAND</i></h4>

<p class="p1">After I had walked about three or four hours, I come along towards the
upper end of the town, where I found there were stores and shops of all
sorts and sizes. And I met a feller, and says I,&mdash;</p>

<p>“What place is this?”</p>

<p>“Why, this,” says he, “is Huckler’s Row.”</p>

<p>“What!” says I, “are these the stores where the traders in Huckler’s
Row keep?”</p>

<p>And says he, “Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” says I to myself, “I have a pesky good mind to go in
and have a try with one of these chaps, and see if they can twist my
eye-teeth out. If they can get the best end of a bargain out of me,
they can do what there ain’t a man in our place can do; and I should
just like to know what sort of stuff these ’ere Portland chaps are made
of.” So in I goes into the best-looking store among ’em. And I see some
biscuit lying on the shelf, and says I,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Mister, how much do you ax apiece for them ’ere biscuits?”</p>

<p>“A cent apiece,” says he.</p>

<p>“Well,” says I, “I shan’t give you that, but, if you’ve a mind to, I’ll
give you two cents for three of them, for I begin to feel a little as
though I would like to take a bite.”</p>

<p>“Well,” says he, “I wouldn’t sell ’em to anybody else so, but, seeing
it’s you, I don’t care if you take ’em.”</p>

<p>I knew he lied, for he never seen me before in his life. Well, he
handed down the biscuits, and I took ’em, and walked round the store
awhile, to see what else he had to sell. At last says I,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Mister, have you got any good cider?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_663">[663]</span></p>

<p>Says he, “Yes, as good as ever ye see.”</p>

<p>“Well,” says I, “what do you ax a glass for it?”</p>

<p>“Two cents,” says he.</p>

<p>“Well,” says I, “seems to me I feel more dry than I do hungry now.
Ain’t you a mind to take these ’ere biscuits again and give me a glass
of cider?” and says he:</p>

<p>“I don’t care if I do.”</p>

<p>So he took and laid ’em on the shelf again and poured out a glass of
cider. I took the glass of cider and drinkt it down and, to tell you
the truth about it, it was capital good cider Then says I:</p>

<p>“I guess it’s about time for me to be a-going,” and so I stept along
toward the door; but he ups and says, says he:</p>

<p>“Stop, mister, I believe you haven’t paid me for the cider.’</p>

<p>“Not paid you for the cider!” says I; “what do you mean by that? Didn’t
the biscuits that I give you just come to the cider?”</p>

<p>“Oh, ah, right!” says he.</p>

<p>So I started to go again, but before I had reached the door he says,
says he:</p>

<p>“But stop, mister, you didn’t pay me for the biscuit.”</p>

<p>“What!” says I, “do you mean to impose upon me? Do you think I am going
to pay you for the biscuits, and let you keep them, too? Ain’t they
there now on your shelf? What more do you want? I guess, sir, you don’t
whittle me in that way.”</p>

<p>So I turned about and marched off and left the feller staring and
scratching his head as tho’ he was struck with a dunderment.</p>

<p>Howsomeever, I didn’t want to cheat him, only jest to show ’em it
wa’n’t so easy a matter to pull my eye-teeth out; so I called in next
day and paid him two cents.</p>

<p>And now humor began to creep into the newspapers, and it came about
that American humorists, almost without exception, have been newspaper
men.</p>

<p>Following Seba Smith’s plan each author created a character,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_664">[664]</span> usually
of homely type, and through him as a mouthpiece gave to the world his
own wit and wisdom.</p>

<p>Mrs. Frances Miriam Whitcher wrote the Widow Bedott papers, and
Frederick Swartout Cozzens the Sparrowgrass Papers, but best known
today is the Mrs. Partington, the American Mrs. Malaprop, created by
Benjamin Penhallow Shillaber.</p>


<h4><i>AFTER A WEDDING</i></h4>

<p class="p1">“I like to tend weddings,” said Mrs. Partington, as she came back
from a neighboring church where one had been celebrated, and hung
up her shawl, and replaced the black bonnet in her long-preserved
band-box. “I like to see young people come together with the promise
to love, cherish, and nourish each other. But it is a solemn thing,
is matrimony&mdash;a very solemn thing&mdash;where the pasture comes into the
chancery, with his surplus on, and goes through with the cerement of
making ’em man and wife. It ought to be husband and wife; for it ain’t
every husband that turns out a man. I declare I shall never forget how
I felt when I had the nuptial ring put on to my finger, when Paul said,
‘With my goods I thee endow.’ He used to keep a dry-goods store then,
and I thought he was going to give me all there was in it. I was young
and simple, and didn’t know till arterwards that it only meant one
calico gound in a year. It is a lovely sight to see the young people
plighting their trough, and coming up to consume their vows.”</p>

<p>She bustled about and got tea ready, but abstractedly she put on the
broken teapot, that had lain away unused since Paul was alive, and
the teacups, mended with putty, and dark with age, as if the idea had
conjured the ghost of past enjoyment to dwell for the moment in the
home of present widowhood.</p>

<p>A young lady, who expected to be married on Thanksgiving night,
wept copiously at her remarks, but kept on hemming the veil that
was to adorn her brideship, and Ike sat pulling bristles out of the
hearth-brush in expressive silence.</p>

<p>Yet not all the wits of the day were newspaper men, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_665">[665]</span> Oliver Wendell
Holmes left his essays and novels now and then to give his native humor
full play.</p>

<p>The “Deacon’s Masterpiece,” often called “The One Hoss Shay” is a
classic, and many short poems are among our best witty verses, while
Holmes’ genial humor pervades his Breakfast Table books.</p>

<p>Henry Wheeler Shaw, creator of the character of Josh Billings, was a
philosopher and essayist as well as a funny man.</p>

<p>Doubtless his work has lived largely because of its amusing
misspelling, but there is much wisdom to be found in his wit.</p>

<p>The following essays are given only in part.</p>


<h4><i>TIGHT BOOTS</i></h4>

<p class="p1">I would jist like to kno who the man waz who fust invented <i>tite
boots</i>.</p>

<p>He must hav bin a narrow and kontrakted kuss.</p>

<p>If he still lives, i hope he haz repented ov hiz sin, or iz enjoying
grate agony ov sum kind.</p>

<p>I hay bin in a grate menny tite spots in mi life, but generally could
manage to make them average; but thare iz no sich thing az making a
pair of tite boots average.</p>

<p>Enny man who kan wear a pair ov tite boots, and be humble, and
penitent, and not indulge profane literature, will make a good husband.</p>

<p>Oh! for the pen ov departed Wm. Shakspear, to write an anethema aginst
tite boots, that would make anshunt Rome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_672">[672]</span> wake up, and howl agin az she
did once before on a previous ockashun.</p>

<p>Oh! for the strength ov Herkules, to tare into shu strings all the tite
boots ov creashun, and skatter them tew the 8 winds ov heaven.</p>

<p>Oh! for the buty ov Venus, tew make a bigg foot look hansum without a
tite boot on it.</p>

<p>Oh! for the payshunce ov Job, the Apostle, to nuss a tite boot and bles
it, and even pra for one a size smaller and more pinchfull.</p>

<p>Oh! for a pair of boots bigg enuff for the foot ov a mountain.</p>

<p>I have been led into the above assortment ov <i>Oh’s!</i> from having
in my posseshun, at this moment, a pair ov number nine boots, with a
pair ov number eleven feet in them.</p>

<p>Mi feet are az uneasy az a dog’s noze the fust time he wears a muzzle.</p>

<p>I think mi feet will eventually choke the boots to deth.</p>

<p>I liv in hopes they will.</p>

<p>I suppozed i had lived long enuff not to be phooled agin in this way,
but i hav found out that an ounce ov vanity weighs more than a pound ov
reazon, espeshily when a man mistakes a bigg foot for a small one.</p>

<p>Avoid tite boots, mi friend, az you would the grip of the devil; for
menny a man haz cought for life a fust rate habit for swareing bi
encouraging hiz feet to hurt hiz boots.</p>

<p>I hav promised mi two feet, at least a dozen ov times during mi
checkured life, that they never should be strangled agin, but i find
them to-day az phull ov pain az the stummuk ake from a suddin attak ov
tite boots.</p>

<p>But this iz solemly the last pair ov tite boots i will ever wear; i
will hereafter wear boots az bigg az mi feet, if i have to go barefoot
to do it.</p>

<p>I am too old and too respektable to be a phool enny more.</p>

<p>Eazy boots iz <i>one</i> of the luxurys ov life, but i forgit what the
other luxury iz, but i don’t kno az i care, provided i kan git rid ov
this pair ov tite boots.</p>

<p>Enny man kan hav them for seven dollars, just half what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_673">[673]</span> they kost, and
if they don’t make his feet ake wuss than an angle worm in hot ashes,
he needn’t pay for them.</p>

<p>Methuseles iz the only man, that i kan kall to mind now who could hav
afforded to hav wore tite boots, and enjoyed them, he had a grate deal
ov waste time tew be miserable in but life now days, iz too short, and
too full ov aktual bizzness to phool away enny ov it on tite boots.</p>

<p>Tite boots are an insult to enny man’s understanding.</p>

<p>He who wears tite boots will hav too acknowledge the corn.</p>

<p>Tite boots hav no bowells or mersy, their insides are wrath and
promiskious cussing.</p>

<p>Beware ov tite boots.&mdash;</p>


<h4><i>A HEN</i></h4>

<p class="p1">A hen is a darn phool, they was born so bi natur.</p>

<p>When natur undertakes tew make a phool, she hits the mark the fust time.</p>

<p>Most all the animile kritters hav instinkt, which is wuth more to them
than reason would be, for instinkt don’t make enny blunders.</p>

<p>If the animiles had reason, they would akt just as ridikilus as we men
folks do.</p>

<p>But a hen don’t seem tew hav even instinkt, and was made expressly for
a phool.</p>

<p>I hav seen a hen fly out ov a good warm shelter, on the 15th ov
January, when the snow was 3 foot high, and lite on the top ov a stun
wall, and coolly set thare, and freeze tew deth.</p>

<p>Noboddy but a darn phool would do this, unless it was tew save a bet.</p>

<p>I hav saw a human being do similar things, but they did it tew win a
bet.</p>

<p>To save a bet, is self-preservashun, and self-preservashun, is the fust
law ov natur, so sez Blakstone, and he is the best judge ov law now
living.</p>

<p>If i couldn’t be Josh Billings, i would like, next in suit tew be
Blakstone, and compoze sum law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_674">[674]</span></p>

<p>Not so far removed from the Josh Billings type of humor is the work
of James Russell Lowell. His well known <i>Biglow Papers</i> exploit
in perfection the back country New England politics as well as native
character.</p>

<p>Edward Everett Hale, George William Curtis, Richard Grant White and
Donald G. Mitchell (Ik Marvel) wrote about this time, but their prose
articles are too long to quote in full and not adapted to condensation.</p>

<p>Again the newspaper writers forge to the front and in George Horatio
Derby we find “the Father of” the new school of American humor. His
sketches, over the name of John Phoenix, began to appear about the
middle of the Nineteenth century and were later collected under the
titles of Phoenixiana and Squibob Papers.</p>

<p>A fragment of one is given.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The dentist went to work, and in three days he invented an instrument
which he was confident would pull anything. It was a combination of the
lever, pulley, wheel and axle, inclined plane, wedge, and screw. The
castings were made, and the machine put up in the office, over an iron
chair rendered perfectly stationary by iron rods going down into the
foundations of the granite building. In a week old Byles returned; he
was clamped into the iron chair, the forceps connected with the machine
attached firmly to the tooth, and Tushmaker, stationing himself in the
rear, took hold of a lever four feet in length. He turned it slightly.
Old Byles gave a groan and lifted his right leg. Another turn, another
groan, and up went the leg again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_679">[679]</span></p>

<p>“What do you raise your leg for?” asked the Doctor.</p>

<p>“I can’t help it,” said the patient.</p>

<p>“Well,” rejoined Tushmaker, “that tooth is bound to come out now.”</p>

<p>He turned the lever clear round with a sudden jerk, and snapped old
Byles’ head clean and clear from his shoulders, leaving a space of four
inches between the severed parts!</p>

<p>They had a <i>post-mortem</i> examination&mdash;the roots of the tooth were
found extending down the right side, through the right leg, and turning
up in two prongs under the sole of the right foot!</p>

<p>“No wonder,” said Tushmaker, “he raised his right leg.”</p>

<p>The jury thought so, too, but they found the roots much decayed; and
five surgeons swearing that mortification would have ensued in a few
months, Tushmaker was clear on a verdict of “justifiable homicide.”</p>

<p>He was a little shy of that instrument for some time afterward; but one
day an old lady, feeble and flaccid, came in to have a tooth drawn, and
thinking it would come out very easy Tushmaker concluded, just by way
of variety, to try the machine. He did so, and at the first turn drew
the old lady’s skeleton completely and entirely from her body, leaving
her a mass of quivering jelly in her chair! Tushmaker took her home in
a pillow-case.</p>

<p>The woman lived-seven years after that, and they called her the
“India-Rubber Woman.” She had suffered terribly with the rheumatism,
but after this occurrence never had a pain in her bones. The dentist
kept them in a glass case. After this, the machine was sold to the
contract or of the Boston Custom-House, and it was found that a child
of three years of age could, by a single turn of the screw, raise a
stone weighing twenty-three tons. Smaller ones were made on the same
principle and sold to the keepers of hotels and restaurants. They were
used for boning turkeys. There is no moral to this story whatever,
and it is possible that the circumstances may have become slightly
exaggerated. Of course, there can be no doubt of the truth of the main
incidents.</p>

<p>Samuel Langhorne Clemens is too well known both by his works and by his
life to need any word of comment. His whole career, as printer, pilot,
lecturer and writer is an open and conned book to all.</p>

<p>Difficult indeed it is to quote from his volumes of fun, but we append
a short extract from <i>The Jumping Frog of Calaveras County</i>.</p>

<p>... Smiley was monstrous proud of his frog, and well he might be, for
fellers that had traveled and been everywheres all said he laid over
any frog that ever <i>they</i> see.</p>

<p>Well, Smiley kep’ the beast in a little lattice box, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_682">[682]</span> used to
fetch him down-town sometimes and lay for a bet. One day a feller&mdash;a
stranger in the camp, he was&mdash;come acrost him with his box, and says:</p>

<p>“What might it be that you’ve got in the box?”</p>

<p>And Smiley says, sorter indifferent-like, “It might be a parrot, or it
might be a canary, maybe, but it ain’t&mdash;it’s only just a frog.”</p>

<p>And the feller took it, and looked at it careful, and turned it round
this way and that, and says, “H’m&mdash;so ’tis. Well what’s <i>he</i> good
for?”</p>

<p>“Well,” Smiley says, easy and careless, “he’s good enough for
<i>one</i> thing, I should judge&mdash;he can outjump any frog in Calaveras
County.”</p>

<p>The feller took the box again, and took another long, particular look,
and give it back to Smiley, and says, very deliberate, “Well,” he says,
“I don’t see no p’ints about that frog that’s any better’n any other
frog.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you don’t,” Smiley says. “Maybe you understand frogs and maybe
you don’t understand ’em; maybe you’ve had experience, and maybe you
ain’t only a amature, as it were. Anyways, I’ve got <i>my</i> opinion
and I’ll resk forty dollars that he can outjump any frog in Calaveras
County.”</p>

<p>And the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder sad like, “Well,
I’m only a stranger here, and I ain’t got no frog; but if I had a frog
I’d bet you.”</p>

<p>And then Smiley says, “That’s all right&mdash;that’s all right&mdash;if you’ll
hold my box a minute I’ll go and get you a frog.” And so the feller
took the box, and put up his forty dollars along with Smiley’s, and set
down to wait.</p>

<p>So he set there a good while thinking and thinking to himself, and
then he got the frog out and prized his mouth open and took a teaspoon
and filled him full of quail shot&mdash;filled him pretty near up to his
chin&mdash;and set him on the floor. Smiley he went to the swamp and slopped
around in the mud for a long time, and finally he ketched a frog, and
fetched him in, and give him to this feller, and says:</p>

<p>“Now, if you’re ready, set him alongside of Dan’l, with his forepaws
just even with Dan’l’s, and I’ll give the word.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_683">[683]</span> Then he says,
“One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;<i>git</i>.” and him and the feller touched up the
frogs from behind, and the new frog hopped off lively, but Dan’l give a
heave, and hysted up his shoulders&mdash;so&mdash;like a Frenchman, but it warn’t
no use&mdash;he couldn’t budge; he was planted as solid as a church, and he
couldn’t no more stir than if he was anchored out. Smiley was a good
deal surprised, and he was disgusted, too, but he didn’t have no idea
what the matter was, of course.</p>

<p>The feller took the money and started away; and when he was going out
at the door, he sorter jerked his thumb over his shoulder&mdash;so&mdash;at
Dan’l, and says again, very deliberate, “Well,” he says, “<i>I</i>
don’t see no p’ints about that frog that’s any better’n any other frog.”</p>

<p>Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan’l a long
time, and at last he says, “I do wonder what in the nation that frog
throw’d off for&mdash;I wonder if there ain’t something the matter with
him&mdash;e ’pears to look mighty baggy, somehow.” And he ketched Dan’l by
the nap of the neck, and hefted him, and says, “Why blame my cats if he
don’t weight five pound!” and turned him upside down and he belched out
a double handful of shot. And then he see how it was, and he was the
maddest man&mdash;he set the frog down and took out after that feller, but
he never ketched him.</p>

<p>James Bayard Taylor and Thomas Bailey Aldrich, friends and congenial
spirits, both despised American Dialect poetry.</p>

<p>Their own work shows a facile wit and graceful fancy, but, with Edmund
Clarence Stedman, they must be classed as writers of light verse rather
than as humorists.</p>

<p>Taylor was good at parody, and in his <i>Echo Club</i>, thus burlesques
the style of Aldrich.</p>

<p>David Ross Locke, who wrote over the name of Petroleum V. Nasby, was a
humorist of the newspapers. He achieved no success until he began to
misspell his words, when he at once leaped into popularity.</p>

<p>But the Prince of Misspellers, excepting always Josh Billings, was
Artemus Ward, the pseudonym of Charles Farrar Browne.</p>

<p>The trick of misspelling and the use of excessive exaggeration were his
stock in trade, added to a certain plaintiveness and abounding good
humor.</p>

<p>Browne was the only one of this group of American humorists,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_685">[685]</span> whose
work was read in England, and he lectured over there with pronounced
success.</p>


<h4><i>ON “FORTS”</i></h4>

some other men’s fort to do another, while there is numeris shiftliss

<p>Shakspeer rote good plase, but he wouldn’t hav succeeded as a
Washington coorespondent of a New York daily paper. He lacked the

<p>That’s so!</p>

<p>Old George Washington’s Fort was not to hev eny public man of the
present day resemble him to eny alarmin extent. Whare bowts can
George’s ekal be found? I ask, &amp; boldly answer no whares, or any whare
else.</p>

<p>Old man Townsin’s Fort was to maik Sassyperiller. “Goy to the world!
anuther life saived!” (Cotashun from Townsin’s advertisement.)</p>

<p>Cyrus Field’s Fort is to lay a sub-machine telegraf under the boundin
billers of the Oshun, and then have it Bust.</p>

<p>Spaldin’s Fort is to maik Prepared Gloo, which mends every thing.
Wonder ef it will mend a sinner’s wickid waze. (Impromptoo goak.)</p>

<p>Zoary’s Fort is to be a femaile circus feller.</p>

tent &amp; krawld threw. Sez I, “My jentle Sir, go out or I shall fall on
to you putty hevy.” Sez he, “Wade in, Old wax figgers,” whereupon I
went for him, but he cawt me powerful on the bed &amp; knockt me threw the
tent into a cow pastur. He pursood the attach &amp; flung me into a mud
puddle. As I arose &amp; rung out my drencht garmints I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_686">[686]</span> koncluded fitin

town in Injianny in the Faul of 18&mdash;, my orgin grinder got sick with
the fever &amp; died. I never felt so ashamed in my life, &amp; I thowt I’d
hist in a few swallers of suthin strengthnin. Konsequents was I histid
in so much I dident zackly know whare bowts I was. I turned my livin
wild beasts of Pray loose into the streets and spilt all my wax wurks.
I then bet I cood play hoss. So I hitched myself to a Kanawl bote,
there bein two other hosses hicht on also, one behind and anuther ahead
of me. The driver hollerd for us to git up, and we did. But the hosses
bein onused to sich a arrangemunt begun to kick &amp; squeal and rair up.
Konsequents was I fownd myself in the Kanawl with the other hosses,
kickin &amp; yellin like a tribe of Cusscaroorus savvijis. I was rescood, &amp;

<p>Frank R. Stockton was a nobleman among the humorists.</p>

<p>His quiet and often subtle humor, his delightful style and his
unique originality made all his stories a joy and some masterpieces.
No quotations can be given, for any Stockton story must be read in
its entirety. <i>The Lady and the Tiger</i> is doubtless the most
celebrated one, but many others are even more clever and unusual.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Francis Bret Harte, famed for his short stories, also wrote humorous
verse. <i>The Heathen Chinee</i> is a byword in all households, and
<i>Truthful James</i> is nearly as well known.</p>

<p>Here Betsey interrupted me. “The deah editah of the <i>Augah</i> has
no need to advise me to read Tuppah, for he is indeed my most favorite
authar. You have devorhed him haven’t you, Josiah Allen’s wife?”</p>

<p>“Devoured who?” says I, in a tone pretty near as cold as a cold icicle.</p>

<p>“Mahtan Fahqueah Tuppah, that sweet authar,” says she.</p>

<p>“No, mam,” says I shortly; “I hain’t devoured Martin Farquhar Tupper,
nor no other man. I hain’t a cannibal.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you understand me not; I meant, devorhed his sweet tender lines.”</p>

<p>“I hain’t devoured his tenderlines, nor nothin’ relatin’ to him,” and I
made a motion to lay the paper down, but Betsey urged me to go on, and
so I read:</p>

<p>I looked right at her ’most a minute with a majestic look. In spite
of her false curls and her new white ivory teeth, she is a humbly
critter. I looked at her silently while she sot and twisted her long
yellow bunnet-strings, and then I spoke out. “Hain’t the editor of the

<p>“Yes,” says she, with a happy look.</p>

<p>Then says I, “If the man hain’t a fool, he’ll think you are one....

and folded it up, and presented it at me like a spear, “the editah of
this paper is a kindred sole; he appreciates me, he undahstands me, and
will not our names in the pages of this very papah go down to posterety
togathah?”</p>

<p>“Then,” says I, drove out of all patience with her, “I wish you was

<h4><i>THE OSTRICH AND THE HEN</i></h4>

<p class="p1">An Ostrich and a Hen chanced to occupy adjacent apartments, and the
former complained loudly that her rest was disturbed by the cackling
of her humble neighbor. “Why is it,” she finally asked the Hen, “that
you make such an intolerable noise?” The Hen replied, “Because I have
laid an egg.” “Oh, no,” said the Ostrich, with a superior smile, “it is
because you are a Hen and don’t know any better.”</p>

<p><i>Moral.</i>&mdash;The moral of the foregoing is not very clear, but it
contains some reference to the Agitation for Female Suffrage.</p>


<h4><i>THE KIND-HEARTED SHE-ELEPHANT</i></h4>

<p class="p1">A kind-hearted She-Elephant, while walking through the Jungle where the
Spicy Breezes blow soft o’er Ceylon’s Isle, heedlessly set foot upon a
Partridge, which she crushed to death within a few inches of the Nest
containing its Callow Brood. “Poor little things!” said the generous
Mammoth. “I have been a Mother myself, and my affection shall atone for
the Fatal Consequences of my neglect.” So saying, she sat down upon the
Orphaned Birds.</p>

of all American families. A short bit is given from:</p>


<h4><i>THE SAD END OF BRER WOLF</i></h4>

<p class="p1">“Bimeby, one day w’en Brer Rabbit wuz fixin’ fer ter call on Miss Coon,
he heered a monst’us fussen clatter up de big road, en ’mos’ ’fo’ he
could fix his years fer ter lissen, Brer Wolf run in de do’. De little
Rabbits dey went inter dere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_709">[709]</span> hole in de cellar, dey did, like blowin’
out a cannle. Brer Wolf wuz far’ly kiver’d wid mud, en mighty nigh
outer win’.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, do pray save me, Brer Rabbit!’ sez Brer Wolf, sezee. ‘Do, please,
Brer Rabbit! de dogs is atter me, en dey’ll t’ar me up. Don’t you year
um comin’? Oh, do please save me Brer Rabbit! Hide me some’rs whar de
dogs won’t git me.’</p>

<p>“No quicker sed dan done.</p>

<p>“‘Jump in dat big chist dar, Brer Wolf,’ sez Brer Rabbit sezee; ‘jump
in dar en make yo’se’f at home.’</p>

<p>“In jump Brer Wolf, down come de lid, en inter de hasp went de hook, en
dar Mr. Wolf wuz. Den Brer Rabbit went ter de lookin’-glass, he did, en
wink at hisse’f, en den he draw’d de rockin’-cheer in front er de fier,
he did, en tuck a big chaw terbarker.”</p>

<p>“Tobacco, Uncle Remus?” asked the little boy incredulously.</p>

<p>“Rabbit terbarker, honey. You know dis yer life ev’lastin’ w’at Miss
Sally puts ’mong de cloze in de trunk; well, dat’s rabbit terbarker.
Den Brer Rabbit sot dar long time, he did, turnin’ his mine over en
wukken’ his thinkin’ masheen. Bimeby he got up, en sorter stir ’roun’.
Den Brer Wolf open up:</p>

<p>“‘Is de dogs all gone, Brer Rabbit?’</p>

<p>“‘Seem like I hear one un um smellin’ roun’ de chimbly cornder des now.’</p>

<p>“Den Brer Rabbit git de kittle en fill it full er water, en put it on

<p>“Den Brer Rabbit went out en git some mo’ wood, en fling it on de fier.</p>

<p>“‘W’at you doin’ now, Brer Rabbit?’</p>

<p>“‘I’m a-chunkin’ up de fier so you won’t git cole, Brer Wolf.’</p>

<p>“Den Brer Rabbit went down inter de cellar en fotch out all his
chilluns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_710">[710]</span></p>

<p>“‘W’at you doin’ now, Brer Rabbit?’</p>

<p>“En de chilluns, dey had ter put der han’s on her moufs fer ter keep

w’at you’ll fine Brer Wolf’s hide hangin’ in de back-po’ch, en all

<h4><i>GOOD JAMES AND NAUGHTY REGINALD</i></h4>

<p class="p1">Once upon a Time there was a Bad boy whose Name was Reginald and there
was a Good boy whose Name was James. Reginald would go Fishing when his
Mamma told him Not to, and he Cut off the Cat’s Tail with the Bread
Knife one Day, and then told Mamma the Baby had Driven it in with the
Rolling Pin, which was a Lie. James was always Obedient, and when his
Mamma told him not to Help an old Blind Man across the street or Go
into a Dark Room where the Boogies were, he always Did What She said.
That is why they Called him Good James. Well, by and by, along Came
Christmas. Mamma said, You have been so Bad, my son Reginald, you will
not Get any Presents from Santa Claus this Year; but you, my Son James,
will get Oodles of Presents, because you have Been Good. Will you
Believe it, Children, that Bad boy Reginald said he didn’t Care a Darn
and he Kicked three Feet of Veneering off the Piano just for Meanness.
Poor James was so sorry for Reginald that he cried for Half an Hour
after he Went to Bed that Night. Reginald lay wide Awake until he saw
James was Asleep and then he Said if these people think they can Fool
me, they are Mistaken. Just then Santa Claus came down the Chimney. He
had lots of Pretty Toys in a Sack on his Back. Reginald shut his Eyes
and Pretended to be Asleep. Then Santa Claus Said, Reginald is Bad and
I will not Put any nice Things in his Stocking. But as for you, James,
I will Fill your Stocking Plumb full of Toys, because You are Good.
So Santa Claus went to Work and Put, Oh! heaps and Heaps of Goodies
in James’ stocking but not a Sign of a Thing in Reginald’s stocking.
And then he Laughed to himself and Said, I guess Reginald will be
sorry to-morrow because he Was so Bad. As he said this he Crawled up
the chimney and rode off in his Sleigh. Now you can Bet your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_714">[714]</span> Boots
Reginald was no Spring Chicken. He just Got right Straight out of Bed
and changed all those Toys and Truck from James’ stocking into his own.
Santa Claus will Have to Sit up all Night, said He, when he Expects to
get away with my Baggage. The next morning James got out of Bed and
when He had Said his Prayers he Limped over to his Stocking, licking
his chops and Carrying his Head as High as a Bull going through a Brush
Fence. But when he found there was Nothing in his stocking and that
Reginald’s Stocking was as Full as Papa Is when he comes home Late from
the Office, he Sat down on the Floor and began to Wonder why on Earth
he had Been such a Good boy. Reginald spent a Happy Christmas and James
was very Miserable. After all, Children, it Pays to be Bad, so Long as
you Combine Intellect with Crime.</p>

<h4><i>THE GARDEN HOSE</i></h4>

<p class="p1">It is now the proper time for the cross-eyed woman to fool with the
garden hose. I have faced death in almost every form, and I do not know
what fear is, but when a woman with one eye gazing into the zodiac
and the other peering into the middle of next week, and wearing one
of those floppy sun-bonnets, picks up the nozzle of the garden hose
and turns on the full force of the institution, I fly wildly to the
Mountains of Hepsidam.</p>

<p>Water won’t hurt any one, of course, if care is used not to forget and
drink any of it, but it is this horrible suspense and uncertainty about
facing the nozzle of a garden hose in the hands of a cross-eyed woman
that unnerves and paralyzes me.</p>

<p>Instantaneous death is nothing to me. I am as cool and collected where
leaden rain and iron hail are thickest as I would be in my own office
writing the obituary of the man who steals my jokes. But I hate to be
drowned slowly in my good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_715">[715]</span> clothes and on dry land, and have my dying
gaze rest on a woman whose ravishing beauty would drive a narrow-gage
mule into convulsions and make him hate himself t’death.</p>

<p>Finley Peter Dunne created the immortal Mr. Dooley about the time of
the Spanish War.</p>

<p>The Irish dialect is perfect, the humor most droll and the wit quiet
and clean-cut.</p>

<p>Among the best of the chapters is the one that burlesques the
proceedings that took place at a celebrated murder trial of the day.</p>


<h4><i>ON EXPERT TESTIMONY</i></h4>

<p class="p1">“Annything new?” said Mr. Hennessy, who had been waiting patiently for
Mr. Dooley to put down his newspaper.</p>

<p>“I’ve been r-readin’ th’ tistimony iv th’ Lootgert case,” said Mr.
Dooley.</p>

<p>“What d’ye think iv it?”</p>

<p>“I think so,” said Mr. Dooley.</p>

<p>“Think what?”</p>

<p>“How do I know?” said Mr. Dooley. “How do I know what I think?
I’m no combination iv chemist, doctor, osteologist, polisman, an’
sausage-maker, that I can give ye an opinion right off th’ bat. A man
needs to be all iv thim things to detarmine annything about a murdher
trile in these days. This shows how intilligent our methods is, as
Hogan says. A large German man is charged with puttin’ his wife away
into a breakfas’-dish, an’ he says he didn’t do it. Th’ question thin
is, Did or did not Alphonse Lootgert stick Mrs. L. into a vat, an’
rayjooce her to a quick lunch? Am I right?”</p>

<p>“Ye ar-re,” said Mr. Hennessy.</p>

<p>“That’s simple enough. What th’ Coort ought to’ve done was to call him
up, an’ say: ‘Lootgert, where’s ye’er good woman?’ If Lootgert cudden’t
tell, he ought to be hanged on gin’ral principles; f’r a man must keep
his wife around th’ house, an’ whin she isn’t there it shows he’s a
poor provider. But, if Lootgert says, ‘I don’t know where me wife is,’
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_721">[721]</span> Coort shud say:’ Go out an’ find her. If ye can’t projooce her in
a week, I’ll fix ye.’ An’ let that be th’ end iv it.</p>

<p>“But what do they do? They get Lootgert into coort an’ stand him up
befure a gang iv young rayporthers an’ th’ likes iv thim to make
pitchers iv him. Thin they summon a jury composed iv poor tired, sleepy
expressmen an’ tailors an’ clerks. Thin they call in a profissor from
a college. ‘Professor,’ says th’ lawyer f’r the State, ‘I put it to
ye if a wooden vat three hundherd an’ sixty feet long, twenty-eight
feet deep, an’ sivinty-five feet wide, an’ if three hundherd pounds
iv caustic soda boiled, an’ if the leg iv a guinea-pig, an’ ye said
yestherdah about bi-carbonate iv soda, an’ if it washes up an’ washes
over, an’ th’ slimy, slippery stuff, an’ if a false tooth or a lock iv
hair or a jawbone or a goluf ball across th’ cellar eleven feet nine
inches&mdash;that is, two inches this way an’ five gallons that?’ ‘I agree
with ye intirely,’ says th’ profissor. I made lab’ratory experiments in
an’ ir’n basin, with bichloride iv gool, which I will call soup-stock,
an’ coal-tar, which I will call ir’n filings. I mixed th’ two over a
hot fire, an’ left in a cool place to harden. I thin packed it in ice,
which I will call glue, an’ rock-salt, which I will call fried eggs,
an’ obtained a dark queer solution that is a cure f’r freckles, which I
will call antimony or doughnuts or annything I blamed please.’</p>

<p>“‘But,’ says th’ lawyer f’r th’ State, ‘measurin’ th’ vat with gas&mdash;an’
I lave it to ye whether this is not th’ on’y fair test&mdash;an’ supposin’
that two feet acrost is akel to tin feet sideways, an’ supposin’ that
a thick green an’ hard substance, an’ I daresay it wud; an’ supposin’
you may, takin’ into account th’ measuremints&mdash;twelve be eight&mdash;th’
vat bein’ wound with twine six inches fr’m th’ handle an’ a rub iv th’
green, thin ar-re not human teeth often found in counthry sausage?’ ‘In
th’ winter,’ says th’ profissor. ‘But th’ sisymoid bone is sometimes
seen in th’ fut, sometimes worn as a watch-charm. I took two sisymoid
bones, which I will call poker dice, an’ shook thim together in a
cylinder, which I will call Fido, poored in a can iv milk, which I will
call gum arabic, took two pounds iv rough-on-rats, which I rayfuse to
call; but th’ raysult is th’ same.’ Question be th’ Coort: ‘Different?’
Answer: ‘Yis.’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_722">[722]</span> Th’ Coort: ‘Th’ same.’ Be Misther McEwen: ‘Whose
bones?’ Answer: ‘Yis.’ Be Misther Vincent: ‘Will ye go to th’ divvle?’
Answer: ‘It dissolves th’ hair.’</p>

<p>“Now what I want to know is where th’ jury gets off. What has that
collection iv pure-minded pathrites to larn fr’m this here polite
discussion, where no wan is so crool as to ask what anny wan else
means? Thank th’ Lord, whin th’ case is all over, the jury’ll pitch
th’ tistimony out iv th’ window, an’ consider three questions: ‘Did
Lootgert look as though he’d kill his wife? Did his wife look as though
she ought so be kilt? Isn’t it time we wint to supper?’ An’, howiver
they answer, they’ll be right, an’ it’ll make little diff’rence wan way
or th’ other. Th’ German vote is too large an’ ignorant annyhow.”</p>

<h4><i>THE FABLE OF THE CADDY WHO HURT HIS HEAD WHILE THINKING</i></h4>

<p class="p1">One day a Caddy sat in the Long Grass near the Ninth Hole and wondered
if he had a Soul. His number was 27, and he almost had forgotten his
Real Name.</p>

<p>As he sat and Meditated, two Players passed him. They were going the
Long Round, and the Frenzy was upon them.</p>

<p>They followed the Gutta-Percha Balls with the intent swiftness of
trained Bird-Dogs, and each talked feverishly of Brassy Lies, and
getting past the Bunker, and Lofting to the Green, and Slicing into the
Bramble&mdash;each telling his own Game to the Ambient Air, and ignoring
what the other Fellow had to say.</p>

<p>As they did the St. Andrews Full Swing for eighty Yards apiece and then
Followed Through with the usual Explanations of how it Happened, the
Caddy looked at them and Reflected that they were much inferior to his
Father.</p>

<p>His Father was too Serious a Man to get out in Mardi Gras Clothes and
hammer a Ball from one Red flag to another.</p>

<p>His Father worked in a Lumber-Yard.</p>

<p>He was an Earnest Citizen, who seldom Smiled, and he knew all about the
Silver Question and how J. Pierpont Morgan done up a Free People on the
Bond Issue.</p>

<p>The Caddy wondered why it was that his Father, a really Great Man, had
to shove Lumber all day and could seldom get one Dollar to rub against
another, while these superficial Johnnies who played Golf all the Time
had Money to Throw at the Birds. The more he Thought the more his Head
ached.</p>

<p>A humorous jingle that achieved immediate vogue is <i>Casey at the
Bat</i>. The authorship has been questioned but consensus of research
seems to ascribe it to Ernest Lawrence Thayer.</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <h4><i>CASEY AT THE BAT</i></h4>
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>It looked extremely rocky for the Mudville nine that day;</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">The score stood four to six, with just an inning left to play;</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">And so, when Cooney died at first, and Burrows did the same,</div>
        <div>A pallor wreathed the features of the patrons of the game.</div>
      </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <div>A straggling few got up to go, leaving there the rest,</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">With that hope which springs eternal within the human breast;</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">For they thought if only Casey could get one whack, at that</div>
        <div>They’d put up even money, with Casey at the bat.</div>
      </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <div>But Flynn preceded Casey, and so likewise did Blake,</div>
        <div>And the former was a pudding and the latter was a fake;</div>
        <div>So on that stricken multitude a death-like silence sat,</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">For there seemed but little chance of Casey’s getting to the bat.</div>
      </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <div>But Flynn let drive a single to the wonderment of all,</div>
        <div>And the much-despised Blakie tore the cover off the ball;</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">And when the dust had lifted, and they saw what had occurred,</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">There was Blakie safe on second, and Flynn a-hugging third.</div>
      </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <div>Then from the gladdened multitude went up a joyous yell,</div>
        <div>It bounded from the mountain-top, and rattled in the dell;</div>
        <div>It struck upon the hillside, and rebounded on the flat;</div>
        <div>For Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat.</div>
      </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <div class="hangingindent">There was ease in Casey’s manner as he stepped into his place,</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">There was pride in Casey’s bearing, and a smile on Casey’s face;</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">And when responding to the cheers he lightly doffed his hat,</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">No stranger in the crowd could doubt ’twas Casey at the bat.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_730">[730]</span></div>
      </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <div class="hangingindent">Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt,</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">Five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt;</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">Then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">Defiance glanced in Casey’s eye, a sneer curled Casey’s lip.</div>
      </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <div class="hangingindent">And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,</div>
        <div>And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there;</div>
        <div>Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped.</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">“That ain’t my style,” said Casey. “Strike one,” the umpire said.</div>
      </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <div class="hangingindent">From the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar,</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">Like the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore;</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">“Kill him! kill the umpire!” shouted some one on the stand.</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">And it’s likely they’d have killed him had not Casey raised his hand.</div>
      </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <div class="hangingindent">With a smile of Christian charity great Casey’s visage shone,</div>
        <div>He stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">He signaled to the pitcher, and once more the spheroid flew,</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">But Casey still ignored it, and the umpire said, “Strike two.”</div>
      </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <div class="hangingindent">“Fraud!” cried the maddened thousands, and the echo answered, “Fraud!”</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">But the scornful look from Casey, and the audience was awed;</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">And they knew that Casey wouldn’t let that ball go by again.</div>
      </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <div class="hangingindent">The sneer is gone from Casey’s lips, his teeth are clenched in hate,</div>
        <div>He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_731">[731]</span></div>
        <div>And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go,</div>
        <div>And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey’s blow.</div>
      </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <div class="hangingindent">Oh! somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright,</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light;</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout,</div>
        <div class="hangingindent">But there is no joy in Mudville&mdash;mighty Casey has struck out.</div>

<p><i>A SYMPOSIUM OF POETS</i></p>

<p>Once upon a time a few of the greatest Poets of all ages gathered
together for the purpose of discussing the merits of the Classic Poem:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_753">[753]</span></p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Peter, Peter, Pumpkin Eater,</div>
        <div>Had a wife and couldn’t keep her,</div>
        <div>Put her in a Pumpkin shell,</div>
        <div>And there he kept her very well.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>In many ways this historic narrative called forth admiration. One must
admit Peter’s great strength of character, his power of quick decision,
and immediate achievement. Some hold that his inability to retain the
lady’s affection in the first place, argues a defect in his nature;
but remembering the lady’s youth and beauty (implied by the spirit of
the whole poem), we can only reiterate our appreciation of the way
he conquered circumstances, and proved himself master of his fate,
and captain of his soul! Truly, the Pumpkin-Eaters must have been a
forceful race, able to defend their rights and rule their people.</p>

<p>The Poets at their symposium unanimously felt that the style of the
poem, though hardly to be called crude, was a little bare, and they
took up with pleasure the somewhat arduous task of rewriting it.</p>

<p>Mr. Ed. Poe opined that there was lack of atmosphere, and that the
facts of the narrative called for a more impressive setting. He
therefore offered:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>The skies, they were ashen and sober,</div>
        <div class="i1">The lady was shivering with fear;</div>
        <div class="i1">Her shoulders were shud’ring with fear.</div>
        <div>On a dark night in dismal October,</div>
        <div class="i1">Of his most Matrimonial Year.</div>
        <div class="i1">It was hard by the cornfield of Auber,</div>
        <div class="i1">In the musty Mud Meadows of Weir,</div>
        <div>Down by the dank frog-pond of Auber,</div>
        <div class="i1">In the ghoul-haunted cornfield of Weir.</div>
      </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <div>Now, his wife had a temper Satanic,</div>
        <div class="i1">And when Peter roamed here with his Soul,</div>
        <div class="i1">Through the corn with his conjugal Soul,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_754">[754]</span></div>
        <div>He spied a huge pumpkin Titanic,</div>
        <div class="i1">And he popped her right in through a hole.</div>
        <div class="i1">Then solemnly sealed up the hole.</div>
      </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <div>And thus Peter Peter has kept her</div>
        <div class="i1">Immured in Mausoleum gloom,</div>
        <div class="i1">A moist, humid, damp sort of gloom.</div>
        <div>And though there’s no doubt he bewept her,</div>
        <div class="i1">She is still in her yellow hued tomb,</div>
        <div class="i1">Her unhallowed, Hallowe’en tomb</div>
        <div>And ever since Peter side-stepped her,</div>
        <div class="i1">He calls her his lost Lulalume,</div>
        <div class="i1">His Pumpkin-entombed Lulalume.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>This was received with acclaim, but many objected to the mortuary
theory.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. Robert Browning was sure that Peter’s love for his wife, though
perhaps that of a primitive man, was of the true Portuguese stamp, and
with this view composed the following pleasing Sonnet:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>How do I keep thee? Let me count the ways.</div>
        <div>I bar up every breadth and depth and height</div>
        <div>My hands can reach, while feeling out of sight</div>
        <div>For bolts that stick and hasps that will not raise.</div>
        <div>I keep thee from the public’s idle gaze,</div>
        <div>I keep thee in, by sun or candle light.</div>
        <div>I keep thee, rude, as women strive for Right.</div>
        <div>I keep thee boldly, as they seek for praise,</div>
        <div>I keep thee with more effort than I’d use</div>
        <div>To keep a dry-goods shop or big hotel.</div>
        <div>I keep thee with a power I seemed to lose</div>
        <div>With that last cook. I’ll keep thee down the well,</div>
        <div>Or up the chimney-place! Or if I choose,</div>

<p>This was of course meritorious, though somewhat suggestive of the
cave-men, who, we have never been told, were Pumpkin Eaters.</p>

<p>Austin Dobson’s version was really more ladylike:</p>

<p>Like the other women present Dinah Craik felt the pathos of the
situation, and gave vent to her feelings in this tender burst of song:</p>

<p>Mr. Hogg took his own graceful view of the matter, thus:</p>

<p>Mr. Kipling grasped at the occasion for a ballad in his best vein. The
plot of the story aroused his old time enthusiasm, and he transplanted
the pumpkin eater and his wife to the scenes of his earlier powers:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>In a great big Mammoth pumpkin</div>
        <div class="i1">Lookin’ eastward to the sea,</div>

        <div class="i1">And I know she’s mad at me.</div>
        <div>For I hear her calling, “Peter!”</div>
        <div class="i1">With a wild hysteric shout;</div>
        <div>“Come you back, you Punkin Eater,&mdash;</div>
        <div class="i1">Come you back and let me out!”</div>
        <div class="i2">For she’s in a punkin shell,</div>
        <div class="i2">I have locked her in her cell;</div>
        <div>But it really is a comfy, well-constructed punkin shell;</div>
        <div class="i2">And there she’ll have to dwell,</div>
        <div class="i2">For she didn’t treat me well,</div>
        <div>So I put her in the punkin and I’ve kept her very well.</div>
      </div>

<p>Algernon Swinburne was also in one of his early moods, and as a result
he wove the story into this exquisite fabric of words:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">

<p>This intense poesy thrilled the heavens, and it was with a sense of
relief to their throbbing souls that they listened to Mr. Bret Harte’s
contribution:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Which I wish to remark,</div>

        <div class="i1">And for tricks that are vain,</div>
        <div>She had predilections peculiar,</div>

        <div class="i1">The lady would stray;</div>
        <div>And whenever he thought he had got her,</div>
        <div class="i1">She was sure to be rambling away.</div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Said Peter, “My Wife,</div>

        <div>For the rest of your life</div>
        <div class="i1">In a big Pumpkin Shell.”</div>
        <div>He popped her in one that was handy,</div>

<p>There was little to be said after this, so the meeting was closed with
a solo by Lady Arthur Hill, using with a truly touching touch:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">

<p>Two of our most gentle and kindly humorists may not be quoted, because
it would be a crime to separate their text and pictures.</p>

<p>Peter Newell and J. G. Francis have drawn some of the most delicately
witty pictures and have written quatrains or Limericks to accompany
them, but picture and text must be shown together, if at all.</p>

<p>For the same reason our cartoonists may not be touched upon.</p>

<p>Nor can we include any writers whose work did not appear before 1900.</p>

<p>The scope of this book is bounded by the twentieth century, and much
as we should like to present the Columnists and the more recent
versifiers, they must be left for a later chronicler.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of

Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
